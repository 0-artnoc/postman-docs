Postman’s vision is to help you build a super fast and smooth workflow for API development keeping some key questions in mind:

*   Where are my APIs and do I know how they are changing?
*   Are they documented properly?
*   How do I follow an agile process to test them?
*   Are they working properly all the time?
*   Can I connect all my tools with my API development workflow?

### Differences between Postman and Postman Pro

Postman Pro offers solutions that satisfy each of the questions above. 

*   *   Team [collaboration](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/Team+Library) for the single source of truth about your API, or review historical versions and the latest updates.
    *   API [documentation](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/API+Documentation) to share public or private documentation, beautifully viewable via a web page.
    *   [Mock servers](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/Mock+servers) to simulate the real API and decouple teams
    *   Collection [monitoring](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/Monitors) to check for the performance, uptime and correctness of your API.
    *   [Pre-built integrations](Integrations_57618152.html) and the [Postman API](Postman-Pro-API_57618180.html) to connect your different tools.
