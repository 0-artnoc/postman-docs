Once a team admin has enabled single sign on (**SSO**) for Postman, user will log into Postman using configured Identity provider. There are two ways of doing this.

1.  User can ask team admin for the **Login URL** which is generated at the time of configuring the **SSO**. The **Login URL** will automatically redirect user to the configured Identity Provider.

2.  User can use **Sign in to Enterprise** button/hyperlink from Postman Web/ Postman App.  

    1.  In Postman App, use the hyperlink at the right top while signing in. On clicking it, a new window will be opened within the app.

    2.  In this step, enter **Team Domain** to continue. **![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/59037264.png)**
    3.  Next, user will be redirected to the configured Identity Provider. Here, for example the **G-Suite** Login screen.
