Public API publishers require public API documentation, and require easy-to-read examples and specifications. Postman publishes [our own API documentation](http://docs.api.getpostman.com) using Postman Pro's documentation. Developers rely on this documentation for learning about the service, implementing their integrations, and debugging. Learn [how to publish your own public docs](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/Publishing+public+docs).

Postman Pro offers automatically generated documentation for all your collections to create public API documentation that is:

##### **Complete**

Your collections are documented with folders, requests, responses, parameters, code snippets, environments, and examples.

##### **Customizable**

Create clear and elegant documentation [using Markdown](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/How+to+document+using+Markdown) in your descriptions for collections, folders, and requests. Publish this documentation on your [custom domain](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/Adding+and+verifying+custom+domains), and further customize the appearance of these pages according to your own brand guidelines. 

##### **Easy**

Publish your API documentation with the click of a button. The pages are automatically generated, and updates are automatically synced.
