Postman's web [dashboard](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard/teams){:target="_blank"} provides a number of ways to [manage your team](/docs/pro/managing_pro/inviting_and_managing). Postman Pro and Enterprise users can [add a team name and logo](/docs/postman/api_documentation/adding_team_name_and_logo) to their Postman team account.

### Custom team URLs

At Postman, we believe our product should have a clean and accessible URL design. Custom team URLs are available for Postman Pro and Enterprise users. This makes Postman features easier to access and streamlines the sign in process. 

Your team URL is shown on the [team page](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard/teams). With a custom team URL, you can access the Postman web view by typing `<your-team-domain>.postman.co` into your browser. 

For example, if my team domain is “postmanlabs”, my custom team URL will now be `postmanlabs.postman.co`, and all features will be predictably accessible by appending `/docs`, `/monitors`, or any other Postman features.
