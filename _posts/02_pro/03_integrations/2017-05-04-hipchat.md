HipChat is an instant messaging app built for businesses. The team chat tool lets you share files and discuss tasks in real-time with colleagues, project collaborators and even clients through unlimited chatrooms. 

This integration allows you to get real-time updates of what is happening in your Postman team.

You can configure HipChat with Postman to monitor results, view a team's activity feed, and use an HipChat Webhook URL.


### Configuring Postman with HipChat

In the [Integrations](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard/integrations){:target="_blank"} page, select HipChat from a list of Postman’s 3rd party Integrations for Postman Pro users.

#### Add a team activity feed to HipChat

The Team Activity Feed is the place where you can view all the things taking place in your team. You can monitor the API development within your team and keep track of all the changes. This integration keeps you updated of all the changes in HipChat itself, so you don’t have to go back to Postman to see the team activity feed.

To add a team activity feed to HipChat:
1. Click the **Add Integration** button.
2. **Add remaining steps**.


#### Send monitor run results to HipChat

You can set up monitors on your collections which run on the cloud at a scheduled interval. This integration allows you to get notifications about your monitor runs into HipChat.

To send monitor run results to HipChat:
1. Click the **Add Integration** button.
2. In the **Monitor Run Results** page, select the monitor you want to send to HipChat, and enter the notification URL.

OLD STUFF
Currently, you can configure HipChat with Postman to monitor results, view a team's activity feed, and use an HipChat Webhook URL.

* Monitoring run results

  You can set up monitors on your collections, which run on the cloud at a scheduled interval. This integration allows you to   get notifications about your monitor runs right into HipChat.

* Viewing team activity feed

  The Team Activity Feed is the place where you can view all your team's activity. You can monitor the API development in your   team and keep track of all the changes. This integration keeps you updated of all the changes in HipChat itself, so you       don't have to go back to Postman to see the team activity feed.

* Using the HipChat webhook URL

  Log in to [HipChat](https://www.hipchat.com/sign_in){:target="_blank"} and navigate to the room where you want Postman to     send you messages. Click on the `Add Integration` button on the right sidebar.
