### Why sign up for a Postman account

Sign up for a free Postman account and get the following benefits:

   *   [Sync](/docs/postman/launching_postman/syncing) and back up your history, collections, environments and header presets.
   *   Easily work on multiple Postman instances from different machines.
   *   Create [collection links](/docs/postman/collections/sharing_collections) to send to other developers.

Signing up is completely optional. Read our [EULA](https://www.getpostman.com/licenses/postman_base_app) and our [security page](https://www.getpostman.com/security) and [privacy page](https://www.getpostman.com/licenses/privacy) to know more.

*   Sign up with your email address or your Google account.
*   Confirm your email and you are good to go.

Once you are logged in, you will see the **IN SYNC** icon at the top telling you that you are connected to our servers. Postman uses WebSockets for real-time [syncing](/docs/postman/launching_postman/syncing). If you are experiencing issues with syncing, [contact us](mailto:help@getpostman.com?Subject=Documentation).
