         **THIS IS A WORKING DRAFT-NOT READY FOR REVIEW**


Workspaces is an easy and efficient way to collaborate with a group of users to develop and test APIs. You can either organize your work in personal Workspaces or work with others in team Workspaces. Postman designed a set of features that unleashes the power and versatiltity Workspaces can provide.

In this topic, you'll learn how to perform actions on Workspaces and how to use Workspaces to work with Postman elements.

### Adding collections and environments from another Workspace

You can add collections or environments from one Workspace to another personal or team Workspace. 

In the [Workplaces dashboard](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard){:target="_blank"}, select a Workspace and click the **Add to workspace** button. The personal Workspaces view appears by default. Click "Team" to add collections or environments to team Workspaces.

[![add to workspaces](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-elipsis-menu-personal.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-elipsis-menu-personal.png)

In the Add to this Workspace page, select the source Workspace that contains the collection or environment you want to add to the target Workspace. Then click "Collection" or "Environment" and select the element(s) you want.

Click the **Add to this Workspace** button. The element(s) appear in your list of collections or environments in the target Workspace.

[![elements list](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-add-WS-results-list.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-add-WS-results-list.png)

### Removing elements from Workspaces

When you remove a Workspace, it is no longer visible in that particular Workspace. The element is still available in any other Workspace where it exists. 

You can remove an element from a Workspace in the Postman app sidebar, or in the [Workspaces dashboard](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard){:target="_blank"}.

#### Removing collections from a Workspace in the sidebar

In the Postman app, select a collection and click the ***Ellipsis (...)*** button.

Click "Remove from Workspace". The collection is no longer visible in the Workspace the appears in the header bar, which is "Neutrino level detection" in this example.

[![remove sidebar](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-remove-WS-via-sidebar.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-remove-WS-via-sidebar.png)

#### Removing elements from a Workspace in the dashboard

In the [Workspaces dashboard](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard){:target="_blank"}, click an element. In this example, we click "Collections".

Click the ***Ellipsis (...)*** button in the element you want to remove and select "Remove from workspace". The Workspace is no longer visible in the Workspace that appears in the header bar, which is "Neutrino level detection" in this example.

[![remove dashboard](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-publish-or-removepWS.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-publish-or-removepWS.png)

### Deleting Workspaces

When you delete an element, you erase its existence in Postman. 

To delete Workspace, go to the [Workspaces dashboard](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard){:target="_blank"} and select a Workspace. In this example, we select a team Workspace to delete.

Click the ***Ellipsis (...)*** button for the element you want to delete and select "Delete".

[![delete workspace menu](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-elipsis-menu-team.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-elipsis-menu-team.png)

In "Delete Workspace", click the **Delete** button. Remember when you delete a Workspace, it is gone forever!

[![delete workspace](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-delete_WS.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-delete_WS.png)


### Joining Workspaces

A user can join a workspace to work on collections, environments, monitors, mocks and integrations in it.

To join a Workspace:

In the Postman app and click a Workspace in the header bar.

Select "Team" and select a Workspace to join under WORKSPACES YOU CAN JOIN.

[![join ws menu](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-join-WS-mainScreen-menu.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-join-WS-mainScreen-menu.png)

In the Collections view, click the **Join** button.

In the confirmation message, click the **Start Building** button to complete the process.

### Sharing collections in Workspaces

#### Sharing collections

[![share collections](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-share-collections-in+WS.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-share-collections-in+WS.png)

#### Sharing collections with the Embed or Run In Postman button

[![share embed-rip](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-embed-a-collection.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-embed-a-collection.png)

#### Sharing collection with a link

[![share get link](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-getLink-collections.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-getLink-collections.png)


#### Sharing collections in the sidebar

[![share sidebar](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-share-collection-sidebar.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-share-collection-sidebar.png)

Sharing in a workspace will be the same action as adding from a private workspace to a team, public or enterprise workspace. However, when an item is shared with a team, it will have an additional owner (the team). If an item is removed from the default workspace of a user, it will still remain in the team's default workspace and will have to be explicitly removed from the team by the team admin or someone with edit access.

### Sharing elements to Workspaces

In this example, we share a collection to a Workspace.

[![share elements](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-share-elements-dashboard.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-share-elements-dashboard.png)

[![share elements-collections](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-share-elements-collection.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-share-elements-collection.png)

### Publishing Workspaces

Postman enables you to [publish your collection](/docs/postman/api_documentation/intro_to_api_documentation){:target="_blank"} and make it availabe to anyone with the published link.

To publish a Workspace collection, go to the [Workspaces dashboard](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard){:target="_blank"} and click a personal or team Workspace.

In the Collections view, click the ***Ellipsis (...)*** and select "Publish".

[![pub workspace](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-publish-or-removepWS.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-publish-or-removepWS.png)

In the Publish Collection page, select the:

* Environment
  The collection's public documentation contains the shared environment.

* Custom domain
  The selected domain contains the published domeain.

* Custom styling options
  You can determine the color of the top bar, right side bar, and the highlight.

[![pub workspace2](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-publish-collection.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-publish-collection.png)

Click the **Publish Collection** button. Postman generates API documentation for your collections automatically in real-time.
