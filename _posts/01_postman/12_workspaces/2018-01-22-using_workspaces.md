         **THIS IS A WORKING DRAFT-NOT READY FOR REVIEW**


Workspaces is an easy and efficient way to collaborate with a group of users to develop and test APIs. You can either organize your work in personal Workspaces or work with others in team Workspaces. Postman designed a set of features that unleashes the power and versatiltity Workspaces can provide.

Read this topic to learn how to perform actions on Workspaces and how to use them to work with Postman elements.

### Adding Workspaces

How to add a workspace.

### Removing Workspaces

#### Removing Workspaces in the sidebar

Removing an entity from any workspace will remove it from that workspace alone. "Remove" will remove an entity from that workspace alone. If the entity exists in any other workspace, they won't be affected. "Delete" will remove the entity from ALL workspaces.

#### Removing Workspaces in the dashboard

### Deleting Workspaces

### Joining Workspaces

A user can join a workspace to work on collections, environments, monitors, mocks and integrations in it.

### Sharing Workspaces

#### Sharing personal Workspaces

### Sharing collections in Workspaces

#### Sharing collections

[![share collections](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-share-collections-in+WS.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-share-collections-in+WS.png)

#### Sharing collections with the Embed or Run In Postman button

[![share embed-rip](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-embed-a-collection.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-embed-a-collection.png)

#### Sharing collection with a link

[![share get link](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-getLink-collections.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-getLink-collections.png)


#### Sharing collections in the sidebar

[![share sidebar](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-share-collection-sidebar.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-share-collection-sidebar.png)

Sharing in a workspace will be the same action as adding from a private workspace to a team, public or enterprise workspace. However, when an item is shared with a team, it will have an additional owner (the team). If an item is removed from the default workspace of a user, it will still remain in the team's default workspace and will have to be explicitly removed from the team by the team admin or someone with edit access.

### Viewing Details
