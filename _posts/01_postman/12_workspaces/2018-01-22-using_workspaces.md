<h3 id="add">Adding Workspaces</h3>

Every entity will have an additional "add to workspace" operation. On selecting this operation, the user will see a list of workspaces to add the entity to.

<h3 id="remove">Removing Workspaces</h3>

Removing an entity from any workspace will remove it from that workspace alone. "Remove" will remove an entity from that workspace alone. If the entity exists in any other workspace, they won't be affected. "Delete" will remove the entity from ALL workspaces.

<h3 id="delete">Deleting a workspace</h3>

<h3 id="join">Joining Workspaces</h3>

A user can join a workspace to work on collections, environments, monitors, mocks and integrations within it.

#<h3 id="share">Sharing Workspaces</h3>

Sharing in a workspace will be the same action as adding from a private workspace to a team, public or enterprise workspace. However, when an item is shared with a team, it will have an additional owner (the team). If an item is removed from the default workspace of a user, it will still remain in the team's default workspace and will have to be explicitly removed from the team by the team admin or someone with edit access.
