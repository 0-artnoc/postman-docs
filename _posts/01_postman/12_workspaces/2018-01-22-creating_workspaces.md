When you create a new Workspace, you must determine whether it is a personal or team Workspace.

Postman account users can create an unlimited number of personal Workspaces. Users who don't have a Postman account can have only one personal Workspace. 

Postman Pro and Postman Enterprise teams have one default team Workspace and can create an unlimited number of Workspaces.

### How to create a new Workspace

Click any Workspace that displays in the header bar. For example, in the image below, you'd click "My Workspace". 

Click "Personal" or "Team" and then click "Create New".
