You can create new personal or team Workspaces and add an existing elements from other Workspaces.

Any element you create in a shared (or teM) Workspace is immediatly available to other team members

Workspaces can be set by the user for different contexts to help them manage things in Postman better: published docs, tests etc. or separate project level workspaces. Workspaces will exist at a single level only - hierarchies can make things complicated.

### Creating a Workspace for an individual user

* Non-signed up users - Only get 1 workspace - (Abhinav's Workspace) - this workspace cannot be shared. A user will have to create a new workspace.

* Signed-up users - Get 2 workspaces (Abhinav's Workspace). Anything that is published goes to the public workspace by default but remains in the default workspace too. The public workspace cannot be shared or made private.

### Creating a Workspace for Pro and Enterprise users

A team will get 2 workspaces on starting a trial or buying Pro or Enterprise. 

* Slack's Workspace

* Slack's Public Public

Anything that is published goes to the public team workspace by default but remains in the shared team workspace too. Enterprise plan users will get an additional default workspace that is only visible to admins.

**Comment from abhijitkane:** 

Also, the last paragraph in https://elispostman.github.io/docs/postman/workspaces/creating_workspaces isn't quite true yet. You can publish documentations even if the root collection is only in a private workspace, and there are no admin-only workspaces yet.
