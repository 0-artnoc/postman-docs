### What is a Workspace?

A Workspace is a collaborative environment for a group of users to develop and test APIs. Individuals can organize their work in personal Workspaces and teams can collaborate in team Workspaces.

Regardless of the type of Workspace, you can share elements in specific teams and mulitiple Workspaces at the same time. We define elements in Postman as collections, monitors, documentation, mocks, environments, and integrations.

**Personal Workspaces**

Personal Workspaces are visible only to you. If you don't have a Postman account, you can have only one personal Workspace. If you do have an account, you can [create](/docs/postman/workspaces/creating_workspaces){:target="_blank"} an unlimited number of Workspaces.

You can remove and delete an element from a Workspace. When you [remove](/docs/postman/workspaces/using_workspaces){:target="_blank"} an element, it is no longer visible in that particular Workspace. However, you can still access that element in any other Workspace where it resides. When you [delete](/docs/postman/workspaces/using_workspaces){:target="_blank"} an element, you completely eliminate it from Postman. 


**Team Workspaces**

Team Workspaces are available to Postman Pro and Postman Enterprise teams. Every team has one default team Workspace, and can [create](/docs/postman/workspaces/creating_workspaces){:target="_blank"} an unlimited number of Workspaces.

In addition, Postman Pro or Enterprise users can convert a personal Workspace to a team Workspace by inviting other team members to [join](/docs/postman/workspaces/using_workspaces){:target="_blank"} the Workspace. If free Postman users invite others to join their personal Workspace, they'll be prompted to create a paid Postman Pro team. Any team member can see and access elements that are shared to any team Workspace

You can share a collection from one Workspace to another. If you have the appropriate permissions for the collection, you can edit and update the collection in any Workspace where it exists.

As a Postman Pro or Enterprise user, you can create team Workspaces for ongoing development or short-term collaborations. You can add and remove Workspace members from among all of the organizationâ€™s paid users. Each Workspace contains a shareable team request history that enables developers to debug requests and API usage collaboratively.

You can sync and share Postman environments directly in Workspaces, without the need for [environment templates](/docs/postman/api_documentation/environments_and_environment_templates){:target="_blank"}.

### Why use Workspaces?

We designed Workspaces to help better organize collections when you collaborate with others. Let's examine a typical scenario of how Workspaces makes collaboration in Postman easier.

Let's say you are working on two projects: Deep Space Nine and Voyager. You have several personal collections that belong not only to projects Deep Space Nine and Voyager, but to other projects, too. 

Perhaps your focus this week has been on Deep Space Nine . Since you have many personal collections, you need to search for the collections you need for Deep Space Nine. To prevent repeated searches for those collections, you mark them as 'favorites'. This action makes them appear at the top of your collections list in the sidebar for quicker access.

[![WS-CollectionsList](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-listCollections-main2.png)](hhttps://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-listCollections-main2.png)

Then, new priorities arrive from your manager, and you need to shift your time and energy to Voyager. You search for Voyager collections in the same manner as Deep Space Nine. When you mark Voyager collections as favorites, Deep Space Nine  collections drop down the list. And if you work on additional projects, the process repeats and eventually all those collections become 'lost in the crowd' again!

Your team also shares a similar challenge. If Deep Space Nine and Voyager have dozens of collections, it's difficult for your team to quickly identify your specific collections. Even if they subscribe to and favorite your collections, they can become lost in a long list of other collections in the sidebar.

Workspaces lets you organize your collections in two separate workspaces, Deep Space Nine and Voyager. In each Workspace you can [add or create](/docs/postman/workspaces/creating_workspaces){:target="_blank"} collections, and invite others to collaborate. Each Workspaces member can see when others add or change an element, such as an environment or monitor. Workspaces also reuse collections, so a collection can be part of Deep Space Nine and Voyager simultaneously, and any change made to the collection in any of these Workspaces will reflect everywhere.

Because Workspaces provides greater visibility and easier acesss to shared collections, the API development workflow is much smoother, and greatly reduces mistakes that occur in collaborative efforts.
