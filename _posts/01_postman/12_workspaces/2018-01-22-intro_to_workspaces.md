### What is a Workspace?

A Workspace is a collaborative environment for a group of users to develop and test APIs. You can create a personal or team Workspace.

Regardless of the type of Workspace, you can share elements in specific teams and mulitiple Workspaces at the same time. We define elements in Postman as collections, monitors, documentation, mocks, environments, and integrations.

**Personal Workspaces**

Personal Workspaces are only visible to you. If you don't have a Postman account, you can have only one personal Workspace. If you do have an account, you can create an unlimited number of Workspaces.

You can invite other users to your Workspace. When you add an element to the Workspace, invited users can automatically see the update. 

You can [remove and delete](/docs/postman/workspaces/using_workspaces){:target="_blank"} an element from a Workspace. When you remove an element, it is no longer visible in that particular Workspace. However, you can still access that element in any other Workspace where it resides. When you delete an element, you completely eliminate it from Postman. 


**Team Workspaces**

When you invite users, you create a team. The team has a default Workspace. Any team member can see and access elements that are shared to any team Workspace

You can share a collection from one Workspace to another. If you have the appropriate permissions for the collection, you can edit and update the collection in any Workspace where it exists.

As a Postman Pro or Enterprise user, you can create shared Workspaces for ongoing development or short-term collaborations. You can add and remove Workspace members from among all of the organizationâ€™s paid users. Each Workspace contains a shareable team request history that enables developers to debug requests and API usage collaboratively.

You can sync and share Postman Environments directly in Workspaces, without the need for templates.

### Why use Workspaces?

We designed Workspaces to help you better organize your collections when you collaborate with others. Let's examine a typical scenario of how Workspaces makes collaboration in Postman API development easier to manage.

Let's say you are working on two projects: A and B. You have several personal collections that belong not only to projects A and B, but to other projects, too. 

Right now you focus your efforts on Project A. Since you have many personal collections, you need to search for the collections you need for Project A. To prevent repeated searches for those collections, you mark them as 'favorites'. This action makes them appear at the top of your collections list in the sidebar for quicker access.

Suddenly your manager declares you also have to work on Project B. You search for Project B collections in the same manner as Project A. When you mark Project B collections as favorites, Project A collections drop down the list. And if you work on an additional projects, the process repeats and eventually all those collections become 'lost in the crowd' again!

Your team also shares a similar challenge. If projects A and B have dozens of collections, it's difficult for your team to quickly identify your specific collections. Even if they subscribe to and favorite your collections, they can become lost in a long list of other collections in the sidebar.

Workspaces allows you to organize your collections in two separate Workspaces, Project A and Project B. In each Workspace you can add or create collections, and invite others to collaborate. Each Workspaces member can see when others add or change an element, such as an environment or monitor. Workspaces also reuse collections, so a collection can be part of Project A and Project B simultaneously, and any change made to the collection in any of these workspaces will reflect everywhere.

Because Workspaces provides greater visibility and easier acesss to shared collections, the API development workflow is much smoother, and greatly reduces mistakes that occur in collaborative efforts.
