### What is a Workspace?

A Workspace is a collaborative environment for a group of users to develop and test APIs. You can create a personal or team Workspace.

Regardless of the type of Workspace, you can share and hide elements in specific teams and mulitple Workspaces at the same time. We define elements in Postman as collections, monitors, documentation, mocks, environments, and integrations.

Workspaces provides three user roles: administrator, member, and non-member.


| **Role**  |   **Permissions**   |
| ---   |   ---     | 
| Administrator   |   View, edit, and manage    |
| Member   |  View and edit    | 
| Non-member   |  View only     | 

**Personal Workspaces**

Personal Workspaces are only visible to you. If you don't have Postman account, you can have only one personal Workspace. If you do have an account, you can have an unlimited number of Workspaces.

You can invite other users to your Workspace, which is only visible to you and those users. When you add an element to the Workspace, it automatically becomes visible to those invited users. You can also assign users as Admins, who can [view, add, create, delete, and remove](/docs/postman/workspaces/using_workspaces){:target="_blank"} elements in the Workspace.

You can [remove and delete](/docs/postman/workspaces/using_workspaces){:target="_blank"} an element from a Workspace. When you remove an element from a Workspace, it is no longer visiable in a personal or team Workspace. When you delete an element, you completly eliminate it from the system. You can only delete an element from your personal Workspace.

**Team Workspaces**

When you invite users, you create a team. The team has a default Workspace. Any team member can see and access elements that are shared to the team Workspace.

You can subscribe to a collection in a shared Workspace and add it to a personal Workspace. If you have the appropriate permissions for the collection, you can edit and update the collection in any Workspace where it exists. 

As a Postman Pro or Enterprise user, you can create shared Workspaces for ongoing development or short-term collaborations. You can add and remove Workspace members from among all of the organizationâ€™s paid users. Each Workspace contains a shareable team request history that enables developers to debug requests and API usage collaboratively.

You can sync and share Postman Environments directly in Workspaces, without the need for templates.

### Why use Workspaces?

We designed Workspaces to help you better organize your collections when you collaborate with others. Let's examine a typical scenario of how Workspaces makes collaboration in Postman API development easier to manage.

Let's say you are working on two projects: A and B. You have several personal collections that belong not only to projects A and B, but to other projects, too. 

Right now you focus your efforts on Project A. Since you have many personal collections, you need to search for the collections you need for Project A. To prevent repeated searches for those collections, you mark them as 'favorites'. This action makes them appear at the top of your collections list in the sidebar for quicker access.

Suddenly your manager declares you have to work on Project B too. You search for Project B collections in the same manner as Project A. When you mark Project B collections as favorites, Project A collections drop down the list. And if you work on an additional projects, the process repeats and eventually all those collections become 'lost in the crowd' again!

Your team also shares a similar challenge. If projects A and B have dozens of collections, it's difficult for your team to quickly identify your specific collections. Even if they subscribe to and favorite your collections, they can become lost in a long list of other collections in the sidebar.

Workspaces enables you to create a Workspace in Project A and Project B. In each Workspace you add or create the collections and invite others to collaborate. The Workspace becomes visible to all members of the Workspace, and all of you can work on the collections. In addition, when you add or change an element, such as an environment or monitor associated with the collection, all Workspaces members can see the updates as they happen.

Workspaces lets you group and view collection elements by team or
