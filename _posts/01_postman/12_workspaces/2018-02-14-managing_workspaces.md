You can manage your personal and team Workspaces. You can perform such tasks as editing names and descriptions, viewing details, and much more.

In the Postman app, click any Workspace that displays in the header bar. In the image below, it's "Team Workspace".

integration, and activity associated with that Workspace. "Collections" is the default view so you see all the collection in this Workspace. If you click the **Share** button, you can [share this collection] with another Workspace. Click the ***Ellipsis (...)*** button to [publish] or [remove the collection].
