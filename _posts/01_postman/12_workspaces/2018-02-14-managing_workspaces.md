                    **THIS IS A WORKING DRAFT**




You can manage your personal and team Workspaces. You can perform such tasks as editing names and descriptions, viewing details, and much more.

In the Postman app, click any Workspace that displays in the header bar. In the image below, it's "Team Workspace".

[![manage workspaces](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-mainScreen-teamenu.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-mainScreen-teamenu.png)

Click "Manage" to display the [Workspaces dashboard](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard){:target="_blank"}.

### Managing personal Workspaces

By default, the personal Workspaces view appears. 

[![add to workspaces](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-elipsis-menu-personal.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-elipsis-menu-personal.png)

In this view, click the **Add to workspace** button to [add collections or environments from another Workspace](/docs/postman/workspaces/using_workspaces){:target="_blank"} to the selected Workspace.

Click the ***Ellipsis (...)*** button to:

* [Share your personal Workspace with other users](/docs/postman/workspaces/using_workspaces){:target="_blank"}.

* [View details about your personal Workspace](/docs/postman/workspaces/using_workspaces){:target="_blank"}.

* [Rename your personal Workspace](/docs/postman/workspaces/using_workspaces){:target="_blank"}.

* [Edit the description of your personal Workspace](/docs/postman/workspaces/using_workspaces){:target="_blank"}.

* [Delete your personal Workspace](/docs/postman/workspaces/using_workspaces){:target="_blank"}.

You can also click the **Create a new workplace** button to [create a new personal or team Workspace](/docs/postman/workspaces/creating_workspaces){:target="_blank"}.


### Managing team Workspaces

In the team Workspaces view, click the ***Ellipsis (...)*** button to:

* [View details about your team Workspace](/docs/postman/workspaces/using_workspaces){:target="_blank"}.

* [Rename your team Workspace](/docs/postman/workspaces/using_workspaces){:target="_blank"}.

* [Edit the description of your team Workspace](/docs/postman/workspaces/using_workspaces){:target="_blank"}.

### Managing Workspace elements

When you click a personal or team Workspace, you can see all the collections, environments, monitors, mocks, integrations, and activity of that Workspace.  

If you click the **Share** button, you can [share this collection](/docs/postman/workspaces/using_workspaces){:target="_blank"} with another Workspace. 

If you click the ***Ellipsis (...)*** button, you can [remove any element](/docs/postman/workspaces/using_workspaces){:target="_blank"} from the Workspace, and [publish](/docs/postman/workspaces/using_workspaces){:target="_blank"} collections.

[![workspace elements](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-add-WS-results-list.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/WS-add-WS-results-list.png)

Let's explore how to manage elements of a Workspace.

**Collections**

Collection is the default view. [Add collections to this Workspace](/docs/postman/workspaces/using_workspaces){:target="_blank"} or [create a collection](/docs/postman/workspaces/creating_workspaces){:target="_blank"} in the Postman app.

**Environments**

Add environments to this Workspace or [create an environment](/docs/postman/environments_and_globals/manage_environments){:target="_blank"} in the Postman app. After you add environments, you can share it with other Workplaces.

**Monitors**

Create monitors to track the performance of collections in a Workspace. You can wait to see performanance at the scheduled run time, or click the Run button to see performance results now.

**Mocks**

[Create a mock server](/docs/postman/mock_servers/setting_up_mock){:target="_blank"} to simulate each endpoint and its corresponding environment in a collection, before sending the actual request. Postman redirects you to the app to create the mock server.

**Integrations**

View a list of integrations or create a Workspace integration. If you create an integration, Postman provides a list of [third party integration apps](/docs/pro/integrations/intro_integrations){:target="_blank"} to help you create the type of integration you want.
