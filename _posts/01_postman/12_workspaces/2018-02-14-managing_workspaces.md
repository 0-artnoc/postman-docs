You can manage your Workspaces to do stuff such as blah, blah, blah.


Click any Workspace that displays in the header bar. Then click "Manage" to display the Workplaces dashboard.

By default, you see the personal Workspaces view. In this view, you can click the **Add to workspace** where you can add collections or environments from another Workspace to the currently selected Workspace.

When you click the ***Elipsis (...)*** button to diplay a menu that enables you to:

* Share your personal Workspace with other users.

* View details about your personal Workspace.

* Change the name of your personal Workspace.

* Edit the decription of your personal Workspace.

* Delete your personal Workspace.
