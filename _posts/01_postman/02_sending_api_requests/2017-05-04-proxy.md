A proxy server acts as a security barrier between your internal network and the Internet, keeping others on the Internet from accessing information on your internal network.

This article describes how to configure the proxy settings in Postman to direct all requests made in the Postman app to route through a proxy server. This is different from [capturing network traffic](/docs/postman/sending_api_requests/capturing_http_requests) with the built-in proxy which allows Postman to intercept network traffic. 

Postman's native apps for Mac, Windows, and Linux support configuring proxies. You can either specify to use a **custom proxy** or to use the **system proxy** defined in the operating system.

Use the **system proxy** if all of your applications need to use the same proxy. Use the **custom proxy** if you want to direct the requests from Postman go through a custom proxy server.

To configure the proxy settings, click the wrench icon on the right side of the header toolbar, choose “Settings”, and select the **Proxy** tab.

### Using custom proxy

This is disabled by default and can be turned on using the toggle switch.

Choose the type of proxy server by checking the appropriate checkboxes. By default, both `HTTP` and `HTTPS` are checked. This means that both HTTP and HTTPS requests will go through the proxy server.

In the first field under **Proxy Server**, enter the **host** or **IP address** (without protocol) of the proxy server. In the second field under **Proxy Server**, enter the **port** of the proxy server.

### Using system proxy

This is enabled by default. Any request made through Postman will go through the system proxy.

You can turn on and off this setting using the toggle switch. When turned off, all the requests are made directly.

**NOTE:** If the **System Proxy** and the **Custom Proxy** are both turned on, then the **Custom Proxy** will take precedence.
