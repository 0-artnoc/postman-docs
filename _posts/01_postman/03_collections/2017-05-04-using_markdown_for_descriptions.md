Postman supports [Markdown](/docs/postman/api_documentation/how_to_document_using_markdown) as a way to style text descriptions for requests, collections, and folders within collections. You can even embed screenshots and other images for more descriptive flair.

Review [reference for using Markdown](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/33232/markdown-in-api-documentation/JsGc){:target="_blank"} in API documentation. 

Postman renders this markdown in the following places:

In the request builder, the request description can be styled with markdown.

The collections details view can be styled with markdown in the descriptions for collections and folders.

For either public or internal API documentation, automatically generated API descriptions (Pro feature) will be styled beautifully and precisely with markdown.
