From the **Collections** tab in the sidebar:

##### **Navigate through collections**

Click on a collection to show or hide the requests that comprise the collection. Use the up and down arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate through the collections. 

##### **Edit and view collection details**

Expand the right angle bracket (**>**) to show the details view for the collection. Collapse the left angle bracket (**<**) to hide the details view. You can add metadata like name and description so that all the information a developer needs to use your API is available easily.

##### **Share a collection** 

Learn more about [sharing collections](/docs/postman/collections/sharing_collections).

### Other collection features

##### **Reorder requests**

Within a collection or folder, you can reorder requests using drag and drop.  The order of folders inside a collection, however, is alphabetical and cannot currently be changed.  

##### **Save responses** 

Requests can also store [sample responses](/docs/postman/sending_api_requests/responses) when saved in a collection.

##### **Add scripts**

Requests stored inside a collection can contain [scripts](/docs/postman/scripts/intro_to_scripts) to add dynamic behavior to the collection.

### Adding folders

Folders are a way to organize your API endpoints within a collection into intuitive and logical groups to mirror your workflow. Next to the collection to which you want to add a folder, click on the ellipses (...) and select "Add Folder".

Add a name and description to the folder. Folders are ordered alphabetically by name, and the folder name and description will be reflected in your API documentation.
