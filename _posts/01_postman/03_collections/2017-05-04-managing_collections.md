From the **Collections** tab in the sidebar:

##### **Navigate through collections**

Click on a collection to show or hide the requests that comprise the collection. Use the up and down arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate through the collections. 

##### Edit and view collection details

Click the right angle bracket (>) to show the details view for the collection. Click the left angle bracket (<) to hide the details view. You can add metadata like name and description so that all the information a developer needs to use your API is available easily.

##### Share a collection 

Learn more about sharing collections [here](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/Sharing+collections).

### Other collection features

##### Reorder requests

Within a collection or folder, you can reorder requests using drag and drop.  The order of folders inside a collection, however, is alphabetical and cannot currently be changed.  

##### Save responses 

Requests can also store [sample responses](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/Responses) when saved in a collection.

##### Add scripts

Requests stored inside a collection can contain [scripts](Scripts_58459441.html) to add dynamic behavior to the collection.

### Adding folders

Folders are a way to organize your API endpoints within a collection into intuitive and logical groups to mirror your workflow. Next to the collection to which you want to add a folder, click on the ellipses (...) and select "Add Folder".

Add a name and description to the folder. Folders are ordered alphabetically by name, and the folder name and description will be reflected in your API documentation.
