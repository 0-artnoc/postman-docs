Postman lets you track, over a specific timeframe, the performance and response of your team or private collections. 

Two major tasks

* Select the collection

* Configure how you want to view the results


### Selecting the collection


1. In the [Dashboard]({{site.pm.gs}}/dashboard){:target="_blank"}, click the "Library" menu and select "Monitors".

2. In [Your Team's Monitors](https://monitor.getpostman.com/){:target="_blank"} page:

  * Click the **Shared** button to see monitors for your shared collections or click the **Private** button to see monitors for your private collections. 

**Note**: All shared monitors are visible to team members, and shared monitors always inherit the permissions of the shared collection.

  * Click the **TIMEFRAME** menu to select if you want performance and response results from the last
24 hours, 7 days, or 30 days.

  * Click the **Monitor a collection** button to [create a new monitor](/docs/postman/monitors/setting_up_monitor){:target="_blank"} for a collection.

  <li>Click on the collection from which you want performance and response.</li>
  </ol>

### Configuring results view

After you click the collection, the Monitor Performance page appears. The default view is "Monitor Summary". In this page you can specify the results you want to see. At the top of your results page, you'll see the graphical visualization of your results.

When you click in the graph, you can scroll down the page to see your written results in the "Test Results" and "Console Log" views.

### How to get Monitors history

* Timeframe for the data you want.

* Shared or private collection.



Split request
an option to change the request graph to see each request individually. By default, you’ll see one line on the graph that represents the total run times for a monitor. If you choose request split, you’ll see a bunch of differently colored lines.
