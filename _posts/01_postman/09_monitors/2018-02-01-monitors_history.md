Postman lets you track, over a specific timeframe, the performance and response of your team or private collections. 

Three major tasks

* Select the collection

* Configure the collection

* View the results


### Selecting the collection


1. In the Dashboard, click the Library menu and select "Monitors".

2. In [Your Team's Monitors](https://monitor.getpostman.com/){:target="_blank"} page:

* Click the **Shared** button to see monitors for your shared collections or click the **Private** button to see monitors for your private collections. 

Note: All shared monitors are visible to team members, and shared monitors always inherit the permission of the shared collection.
