Postman users with the **Admin** member role can add a team name and logo to their Postman team account directly from the [Team Settings page](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard/teams/edit).

### Update your team name

To see your current team name, go to the [Team page](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard/teams) in the Postman website.

If you didn’t enter a team name when you first created your Postman Pro or Enterprise team, you can add it in the [Team Settings page](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard/teams).

### Update your team logo

From the [Team page](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard/teams), click the gear icon in the top right, and select “Edit team” to add or update your team logo.

This uploaded image will display in the header of your team's [published documentation](/docs/postman/api_documentation/intro_to_api_documentation) instead of the Postman logo. It may take up to 5 minutes for the logo to update.
