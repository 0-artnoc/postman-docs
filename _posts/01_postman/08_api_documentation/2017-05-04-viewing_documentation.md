Postman users can use two different web views while authoring documentation for their Postman Collections: private and public. 

All Collections are initialized with the private view. However, users must explicitly opt to publish their documentation for it to be available publicly. 

Private, unpublished Collections are only available to the author, while Collections shared in the Team Library can be accessed by the entire team. Published Collections can be viewed by anyone who has the URL.

### Viewing Private Documentation

Private documentation can only be viewed by its author unless the collection is shared within their Postman Pro or Postman Enterprise Team Library. 

Teammates with “Can View” permissions can oversee progress, while teammates with “Can Edit” permissions can collaborate in writing, revising, and updating documentation. 

You must be logged in to your Postman Account to view private documentation.

In the Postman app, hover your cursor over your Collection on the left-hand side, click the right angle bracket (>), then click the **View in web** button.

To view documentation for a shared collection, navigate to your Team Library in your Postman app. 

Locate the collection you’d like to view, then click the **View in web** button next to it.

In this private web view, you’ll be able to see each request in the collection, their descriptions, and code snippets generated from the environment and the language you’ve selected.

Note that this private URL is only accessible to Postman users logged in with the appropriate credentials — anyone without access to the collection itself will receive an error message upon attempting to view it.

To make this documentation available to others, you will need to publish it.

### Viewing Public Documentation

Public documentation is viewable through the URL that Postman generates when you publish it. This link will be displayed immediately and can be located later on in your Postman Dashboard. 

If you’ve added and verified a custom domain, then selected it while publishing, your documentation will be displayed there.
