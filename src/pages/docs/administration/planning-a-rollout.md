## Developing a Rollout Strategy

Having a rollout strategy ensures a smooth deployment of Postman in your organization. This stratagy can cover the initial introduction, but it can also be long-term.

### Promote the Benefits

* Postman serves as a cloud based Repository for all of your API development, testing, and documentation. This repository serves as a single point of truth for your APIs and shifts source control from individual users to the team workspace.

* Your API documentation is generated from your collections and is easy to maintain from within the Postman Application.

* Team workspaces allow your team to collaborate on a single source. This means collections are easier to find. Documentation is generated from the collection which keeps it up to date. Documentation features code samples and allows for the collection to be easily imported into the Postman application. All of these things add up to faster developer onboarding!

* When the API is the first and primary interface for your application in design or coding, we call this __API-First__. An API-First approach reduces redundant interfaces, reduces the overall complexity of an application or system; therefore reducing the effort to maintain it.

### Organize your Workspaces

* Establish the importance of Workspace Organization, Naming Conventions & Roles

* Most teams organize their workspaces based organizational structure or on lines of business. However you decide to organize your collections make sure they are easy to navigate to.
