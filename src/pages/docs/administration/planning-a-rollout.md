## Developing a Rollout Strategy

Having a rollout strategy ensures a smooth deployment of Postman in your organization. This stratagy can cover the initial introduction, but it can also be long-term.

### Promote the Benefits

Postman provides many collaborative features designed to improve the efficiency of API delevopment. Odds are that your team has experienced challenges at some time or another and could benefit from one or more of these features.

* #### Source Control

  Postman serves as a cloud based Repository for all of your API development, testing, and documentation. This repository serves as a single point of truth for your APIs and shifts source control from individual users to the team workspace.

* #### Documentation

  Postman closes the gap between development and documentation by generating documentation straight from your collections. This makes documentation simple to maintain and with less overhead.

* #### Developer Onboarding

  Team workspaces allow your team to collaborate on a single source. This means collections are easier to find. Documentation is generated from the collection which keeps it up to date. Documentation features code samples and allows for the collection to be easily imported into the Postman application. All of these things add up to faster developer onboarding!

* #### API-First Principles

  When the API is the first and primary interface for your application in design or coding, we call this __API-First__. An API-First approach reduces redundant interfaces, reduces the overall complexity of an application or system; therefore reducing the effort to maintain it.

### Organize your Workspaces

It is important that everyone on your team can find things quickly and easily. Formalizing a standard naming convention for your team's workspaces and collections ensures everyone has a common language to use for your projects.

Most teams organize their workspaces based organizational structure or on lines of business. The goal should be to strike a balance between the number of workspaces and the number of collections in each workspace.

### Internal Wiki Page

An internal wiki is knowledge resource for standards, processes, projects, or products your team is building. Internal wikis are an affective tool in improving developer onboarding. Including information about your Postman team and workspaces allows new members of your team to find answers on their own.

* List to your workspaces
* List your team and workspace admins
* Provide documentation on how to use Postman
* clarify your naming conventions and method of organization
* Provide your support process and links to Postman support resources

We have developed a template to give you a leg up in the process of developing your internal wiki page.
