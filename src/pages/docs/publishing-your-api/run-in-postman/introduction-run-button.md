The Run in Postman button is one way to share a Postman collection with your users. This button is displayed in the [Postman API Network](/docs/publishing-your-api/add-api-network/), at the top of [published documentation](/docs/publishing-your-api/publishing-your-docs/) in the web, and also where publishers choose to embed the stand-alone button.

When you [create a stand-alone button](/docs/publishing-your-api/run-in-postman/creating-run-button/), you can embed a collection (and optional environment) in your website or API documentation. From this button, users can then import a copy of your collection directly into Postman.

## User interaction with your button

When a user comes across your button, they can view the collection in their web browser or import the collection into the Postman app. 

Â ![Modal display](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/Unsized+modal+image.jpg)

> If the button is dynamic, the prompts will open for the user in a modal, like the screenshot above (above modal is specific to Macs). If the button is static, the prompts will open for the user in a new page.

A copy of your collection is imported into the user's app, and the app will open on the user's desktop. This collection is a copy of the original, so updates made to the original are not updated in these copies imported by users.

> **Security check**: Do not leak sensitive data like access keys in your collection or environment. Read more about [securely using API keys in Postman](https://blog.postman.com/how-to-use-api-keys/).
