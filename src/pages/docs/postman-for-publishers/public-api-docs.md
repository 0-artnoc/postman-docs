API documentation helps developers onboard and adopt your services. Effective documentation aids learning around the purpose of your API and provides the information developers need to integrate it into their applications and workflows. You can [generate documentation directly from Postman collections](/docs/postman/api-documentation/documenting-your-api/)â€”and can add a variety of optional details throughout your docs.

> If you aren't planning to publish your own API but are looking for APIs to use / integrate with, search the API Network and Postman templates for your use case. Whether you want to find sushi restaurants near you or integrate your CI/CD pipeline with your enterprise messenger, there's an API that can help with that. When you find what you're looking for, import the collection by clicking the [Run in Postman button](/docs/postman-for-publishers/run-in-postman/creating-run-button). From here you can try out the endpoints in Postman.

Once your is documentation ready for viewing publicly, you can use the API Network and templates to make it more discoverable via the Postman community.

> The Postman [API documentation](http://docs.api.getpostman.com) is itself generated from Postman.

__Before you can share your documentation throughout the Postman network, you will first need to learn how to [author](/docs/postman/api-documentation/authoring-your-documentation/) and [publish](/docs/postman/api-documentation/publishing-your-docs/) your collections.__

## Making your documentation discoverable

Once you make your docs public, anyone with the link can access them. With the API Network and templates, you can make them discoverable to a wider range of consumers by leveraging the Postman community.

You can publish docs for a team collection to the API Network, and as an individual user you can publish to the shared templates. You can access both the API Network and Postman community templates inside the Postman app via the __New__ button, and [on the web](https://explore.postman.com).

You will see lots of sample templates and team docs to inspire your own.

## Next steps

* If you are publishing docs for a collection via your team, share them by [adding to the API Network](/docs/postman-for-publishers/api-network/add-api-network).
* If you are publishing as an individual user, [share your docs via the templates](/docs/postman-for-publishers/postman-templates/add-templates).
