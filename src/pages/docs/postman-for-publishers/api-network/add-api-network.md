Publishing your documentation to the [API Network](https://explore.postman.com/) connects your API to the Postman community. You can publish docs to the network from any team collection—_for individual collections that are not published via a team, you can instead add to the Postman [templates](/docs/postman-for-publishers/postman-templates/add-templates/)_.

Sharing your docs exposes your API to the millions of developers who use Postman, and lets others within the community learn from your projects. By publishing to the API Network, you share both as a human-readable reference in the form of your docs—and an executable way to interact with your API endpoints inside Postman, via the embedded Run in Postman button.

Your docs can convey detailed guidance on how to make requests to your API endpoints, and the workflows required to integrate with your API in general. This provides the information and actionable data developers need to get started using your services. Connecting to the API Network also gives you access to metrics around how many people are using your APIs, and insights you can use to refine future versions.

### Adding your API

For API publishers, you can add your API to the API Network when [publishing your collection](/docs/postman/api-documentation/publishing-public-docs), or while editing your Collection Discovery details. Ensure your API has an API name, summary, and description.

Select the categories that best describe your API and service. Once submitted, the Postman team will review the submission for approval before your API is accessible to millions of developers worldwide.

### Update team public profile

Under your [team settings](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/public), verify your team's public profile details including your team name, team description, organization logo, and favicon.

This information will be displayed to users on your team's profile page, along with a listing of your published APIs and templates.

If you choose to disable your team profile, you won't be able to publish any new collections to the Postman API Network or templates, and any previously published collections will be unpublished.

### Update user public profile

Under your [personal settings](https://go.postman.co/settings/me/public), verify your public profile details including your name, description and profile photo. Similar to your team's public profile, user information will be displayed on your user profile page, along with a listing of your published templates.

If you choose to disable your user profile, you won't be able to publish any new templates and any previously published templates will be unpublished.
