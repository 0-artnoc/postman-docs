The Run in Postman button is a way to give your teammates and developers working with your APIs direct access to your endpoints. When you create a button for your collections and then embed that button in your documentation, webiste, or GitHub repo, your collections will open in the Postman app any time a user clicks the button.

> The Run in Postman button works with all description formats like Swagger, RAML, and GitHub.

## The 2 types of Run in Postman buttons

**Dynamic**: Uses HTML and CSS. Optimal for a website where you have permission to edit the site's source code.

**Static**: Uses Markdown. Optimal for a Markdown document like a GitHub ReadMe or BitBucket repository.

## Use dynamic buttons to access the Run in Postman API

The [Run in Postman API](/docs/postman-for-publishers/run-in-postman/run-button-API/) is accessible through the dynamic Run in Postman button. The API uses the `pm()`method, which you can leverage to create and modify ennvironments that you include with your button. When you include an environment with your button, it will open in the Postman app along with your collections whenever a user clicks your button. The user can then input their own [variable values in the environment](/docs/postman/variables-and-environments/variables/).

When you use the Run in Postman button to share collections, you can also include [environments](/docs/postman/collection-runs/using-environments-in-collection-runs/). When developers click your Run in Postman button, the environment will open along with your collection in Postman, and the user can then leverage those environments to input and save their own variable values.

With the dynamic button, you have access to the Run in Postman API, which is a series of JavaScript functions that you can use to create, delete, modify, and segregate environments. To change your button's behavior, you have to have permission to edit the source code of the website where the button is embedded. From there, you can write the functions in the button's script.

> The Run in Postman API only works with the dynamic Run in Postman button.
