You can share your documentation for any collection you publish by adding it to the Postman templates. Adding your templates makes them available to the Postman community through the app via __New__ &gt; __Templates__ and [on the web](https://explore.postman.com/templates).

Your template listing provides access to the documentation for your API collection, and the __Run in Postman__ button, which allows anyone to import the collection directly into the Postman app. Community members can browse and search for templates to learn and automate tasks relevant to a wide variety of use cases. People can also access your Postman profile via your template listings.

By publishing your collection docs to the Postman templates, you're sharing both human-readable and executable data that helps people get started using APIs. Your docs can outline how to use a single endpoint as well as how to integrate with an API as a whole, helping community members learn API skills and discover available services.

> If you're publishing documentation from a team API, you can [add it to the API Network](/docs/postman-for-publishers/api-network/add-api-network/) as part of your team listing.

## Adding your templates

You can share your collections to the Postman templates during the docs [publishing process](/docs/postman/api-documentation/publishing-your-docs/), or later. During publication, check __Collection discovery__ and select __Add to Postman Templates__.

If your collection documentation is already published, you can make it discoverable by editing the published docs.

### Providing template detail

Enter display details for your template listing, including __Template Name__, __Summary__, and __Description__. Your description will be automatically pulled from any [description you have added to your collection already](/docs/postman/api-documentation/authoring-your-documentation/), and should include the information potential users will need to know whether to try the template or not.
