* [Reading comments](#reading-comments)
* [Editing comments](#editing-comments)
* [Deleting comments](#deleting-comments)
* [Tagging members in comments](#tagging-members-in-comments)

## Posting comments

**Notes:**

* Postman app currently supports comments on requests only.
* Only those having access to a collection or a request will be able to post comments.
* You can only post comments on saved requests.

### Posting comments on a collection

You can leave a comment on a collection through the [Postman Dashboard](https://app.getpostman.com). To post a comment on a collection, navigate to the `Collections` tab at the top of the page, select the collection you want to leave a comment on and then click the **Comments** button on the right of the collection title (circled in red in the picture below).

### Posting comments on a request

You can post comments on requests from the [Postman Dashboard](https://app.getpostman.com) or the Postman app. When you post a comment on a request, it gets reflected in both the Dashboard and the app.

To post a comment, select the corresponding request and click **Comments**. The **Comments** dialog box appears. Write your comment and click *Add Comment*. Your comment is posted. The procedure to post a comment is similar both in the Postman app and the Dashboard. The following screen illustrates this:

**Note:** If someone tags you in a comment on a private collection that you don’t have access for, Postman sends a notification to you. However, you can’t read the comment until the collection or the request is shared with you.  

## Reading comments

You can access the comments left on requests and collections by your teammates with the Postman app or the Postman dashboard.

### Reading comments on the Postman app

First, navigate to the request for which you want to read the comments by navigating to it using the left sidebar. Once you have opened on the correct request click on the **Comments** button (circled in red in the picture below) at the top-right corner of the request to see the existing comments.

**Note:** The comment button displays the number of existing comments between brackets.

### Reading comments on the Postman dashboard

To read the comments on a collection, navigate to the `Collections` tab at the top of the page, select the collection you want to see the comments of and then click the **Comments** button on the right of the collection title as shown in the animated picture below.

## Editing comments

After posting a comment, you can go back, edit your comment and save your changes. Only you as a creator of the comment will be able to update/modify your comment. The following screen illustrates this:

You can delete your comments by clicking the ‘delete’ button, as illustrated in the below screen (circled in red):

**Note:** For moderation purposes, Admins can delete anyone’s comment. However, admins will not be able to update/modify a comment.

## Tagging members in comments

Sometimes you may want to call the attention of a team member when posting a comment. In such a scenario, you can tag a person by typing the @ symbol followed by the member’s name and then choosing the corresponding name from the auto-suggested list. When you tag a member in your comment, Postman notifies the member by sending a notification. The following screen illustrates tagging a member in a comment:

For more information on formatting using Markdown refer to [Markdown in API Documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/33232/markdown-in-api-documentation/JsGc?version=latest).
