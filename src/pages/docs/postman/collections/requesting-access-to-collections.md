4. Complete your request by clicking **Request Access**.

This will trigger an email to the person you requested access from. When they approve your request, you will be notified by email. Your request will expire in 15 days, but you can make additional requests on the same collection after that period.

## Requesting editor role on a collection

There might be collections that you can view but not edit. These collections have a 'lock' icon next to the collection name.

## Approving requests for access

Your team members can request access from you in the following cases:

1. If your team members have the link to a personal collection, they won't be able to view it, but they will be able to see the name and request access to it.

2. If you have the Editor role on a collection that is shared, a team member who has the Viewer role will be able to request an additional role from you.

You will receive an email detailing the request for access.

Click **Approve Request** if you want to grant access to the collection. If you do not wish to give access, you can ignore the request. A request for access will expire in 15 days.
