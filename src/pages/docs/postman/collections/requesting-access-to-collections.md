## Requesting editor role on a collection

There might be collections that you can view but not edit. These collections have a 'lock' icon next to the collection name.

## Approving requests for access

Your team members can request access from you in the following cases:

1. If your team members have the link to your personal collection, they won't be able to view it but they will be able to see the name and request access to it.

2. For collections that are shared, a team member who has the Viewer role will be able to request additional role from you if you have the Editor role.

You will receive an email detailing the request for access.

If you want to approve this request, you can click the **Approve** button and the request will be approved. If you do not wish to give access, you can ignore the request. A request for access expires in 15 days.
