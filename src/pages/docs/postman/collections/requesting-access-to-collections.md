4. Complete your request by clicking on **Request Access**

This will trigger an email to the person you requested access from. When they approve your request, you will be notified by an email. Until your request is approved or gets expired (after 15 days), you won't be able to make a request on the same collection.

## Request Editor Role on a Collection

There might be collections that you can view but not edit. These collections have a 'lock' icon next to the collection name.

## Approving Requests for Access

Your team members can request access from you in the following cases:

1. If your team members have the link to your personal collection, they won't be able to view it but they will be able to see the name and request access to it.

2. For collections that are shared, a team member who has the Viewer role will be able to request additional role from you if you have the Editor role.

In both these cases, you will receive an email with the following details

If you want to approve this request, you can click on the **Approve** button and the request will be approved. If you do not wish to give access, you can ignore the request. A request for access expires in 15 days.
