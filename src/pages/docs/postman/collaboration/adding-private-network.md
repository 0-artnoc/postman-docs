You can publish the APIs that the teams in your organization use internally to the Private API Network. When you publish to the Private API Network, your team can access your APIs and start working with them immediately.

You can access the Private API Network from the [Dashboard](https://www.postman.com). From there, you can publish your team's finished APIs, and the members of your team can browse APIs that you have added.

> Only members of your team will be able to access your APIs.

### Adding your APIs

To add a private API for your team, sign in to your [Dashboard](https://www.postman.com) and click **API Network** at the top.

> Open your browser to sign in to the [Dashboard](https://www.postman.com).

Click your team name at the top left.

The developers building the APIs for your organization's internal use will be able to see which APIs and collections have been added to the Private API Network from your workspace.

> APIs that have already been added to the Private API Network cannot be added again. If a team member tries to add an API that already exists on the network, they will get an error message telling them that API has already been added.

#### Security

When users sign in to Postman, only the private APIs for the teams associated with their login credentials will be visible to them. Private APIs will not be discoverable or accessible to anyone who is not a part of your team.

#### Guidelines

Only APIs in which all team members have been granted "View access" can be added to the Private API Network. You will not be able to add your private APIs to the network until you have given everyone on your team at least "View" access to the API.

## Discovering and consuming private APIs

You can find the APIs that your team has added to the Private API Network by browsing through your team's Private API space on the [Dashboard](https://www.postman.com).

Sign in to the [Dashboard](https://www.postman.com) and click **API Network**.
