You can publish the APIs that the teams in your organization use internally to the Private API Network. When you publish to the Private API Network, your team can access your APIs and start working with them immediately.

You can access the Private API Network from the [Dashboard](https://www.postman.com). From there, you can publish your team's finished APIs, and the members of your team can browse APIs that you have added.
