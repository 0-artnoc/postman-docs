Postman provides a strong API development toolchain that integrates seamlessly with the developer's workflow.

Postman supports an open ecosystem, working with industry leaders to introduce new features and integrations that make API development easier and faster.

## What is an integration?

Organizations use the term "integration" inclusively, sometimes overly so. In fact, different teams in the same organization might use the term in different ways.

Postman views "integrations" as a way to share data or functionality between Postman and other tools that you might use for API development. When manually importing and exporting data from one application to another becomes a chore, an integration can help.

If you use GitHub for your repository management and use Postman to develop and test your APIs, you can save your Postman Collections to your GitHub repository with the [Postman to GitHub integration](/docs/integrations/github/).

## Postman integrations

You can access over a dozen built-in integrations by navigating to your workspace in the [web dashboard](https://go.postman.co/workspaces), then selecting **Integrations** > **Create an integration in this workspace**.

In the Dashboard page, click ["Integrations"](https://go.postman.co/workspaces).
