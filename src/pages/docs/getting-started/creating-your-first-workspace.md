Postman workspaces allow you to organize and collaborate on API projects with your team. Within each workspace you can share APIs, collections, environments, and other components of your work in Postman.

When you first open Postman, you will be in the default personal workspace, but you can create more workspaces for your personal use and to work in conjunction with teammates.

> To create additional workspaces, you need to be signed into a [Postman account](/docs/getting-started/postman-account/).

To access your workspaces, use the dropdown at the top in the center of the Postman app.

If you are part of a team, you will see available workspaces under __Team__. You can invite people to existing workspaces.

Click __Create New__ to add a new workspace.

You can choose a __Team__ workspace if you plan to invite collaborators, or a __Personal__ workspace. Enter a __Name__ and optional __Summary__ for your workspace. If you're collaborating, you can invite other people now or later, and select access levels. Click __Create Workspace__.

Postman will switch to your new workspace when you create it. You can then start working in the workspace or __Invite__ people to join it. Select a workspace to switch to it at any time using the dropdown at the top of the Postman app.
