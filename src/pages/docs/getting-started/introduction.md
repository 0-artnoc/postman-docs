Welcome to the Postman docs! This is the place to find official information on using Postman in your API projects.

What are you here to learn about?

* [__APIs and Postman__](#apis-and-postman)
* [__Making API requests__](#making-api-requests)
* [__Producing APIs__](#producing-apis)
* [__Collaborating within your organization__](#collaborating-within-your-organization)
* [__Developing with Postman__](#developing-with-postman)

## APIs and Postman

If you're just starting to learn about APIs and Postman, you can use a variety of channels both in and outside the app itself:

* [Sending your first request](/docs/getting-started/sending-the-first-request/)â€”explore the other topics in __Getting Started__.
* Using the __Bootcamp__ to work through lessons inside Postman.
* Exploring [templates](https://explore.postman.com/) to try out, like [Learn by API](https://explore.postman.com/templates/7499/learn-by-api), which walks you through API concepts.

## Making API requests

If you're building a client app, you can connect to the API in Postman:

* [Connecting to APIs](/docs/sending-requests/requests/)
* [Authorizing requests](/docs/sending-requests/authorization/)
* [Grouping requests in collections](/docs/building-and-running-collections/intro-to-collections/)
* [Visualizing data](/docs/sending-requests/visualizer/)

## Testing APIs

If you're testing an API, you can use Postman to automate various parts of the process:

* [Writing test scripts](/docs/writing-scripts/test-scripts/)
* [Using variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/)
* [Automating workflows with the collection runner](/docs/building-and-running-collections/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/)

## Producing APIs

If you or your organization is exposing an API for public use, Postman can help support various aspects of onboarding and API management:

* [Creating an API from scratch](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/the-api-workflow/)
* [Publishing documentation](/docs/publishing-your-api/documenting-your-api/)
* [Building adoption](/docs/publishing-your-api/add-api-network/)
* [Analyzing API performance](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/observing-your-api/intro-monitors/)

## Collaborating within your organization

If you're using Postman in your company or team, check out these guides to maximize on your collaboration:

* [Collaborating in Postman](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/collaboration-intro/)
* [Managing Postman for an organization](/docs/administration/admin-intro/)
* [Onboarding your team](/docs/administration/onboarding-checklist/)
* [Setting up an integration](/docs/integrations/intro-integrations/)

## Developing with Postman

* [Integrating with a development pipeline](/docs/building-and-running-collections/using-newman/command-line-integration-with-newman/)
