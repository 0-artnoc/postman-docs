## Billing dashboard

Postman's [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing) provides a number of ways to manage your team's billing.

### Viewing account history

In your [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing), select **Account History**. This page allows you to quickly note your team's history billing activity, as well as the day and time actions took place. 

[![account history](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/account-history.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/account-history.jpg)

Items such as updates to your Postman subscription, card changes, payments, and charges are all listed in chronological order for easy reference.  

### Viewing past invoices

In your [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing), select **Invoices**. To get a copy of an invoice, hover over the listing on the page and select **Get Invoice**.

[![invoices](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/invoices.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/invoices.jpg)

To add or edit the information on an invoice, see [adding custom information to invoices](/docs/postman-pro/managing-pro/billing#adding-custom-information-to-invoices).

### Managing overages

In your [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing), select **Overages**. Check or uncheck the box to enable or disable monitoring overages for your team.

[![monitoring overages](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/monitoring-overages.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/monitoring-overages.jpg)

> If your API development pipeline is dependent on Postman monitoring, disabling overages may cause unintended consequences. To avoid this as well as potentially fluctuating pay-as-you-go charges, check out [pre-paid monitoring blocks](/docs/postman/monitors/pricing-monitors/#request-blocks-for-pro-and-enterprise-teams).

## Payments 

Postman offers various payment options dependent on plan type. Postman Pro is card-only, while Postman Enterprise can be purchased via card or invoice.

### Managing cards

In order to add, remove, or set a default card, select **Payment Methods** in your [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing). 

To add, click **Add A New Card**. 

To remove, hover over the card in question and select the trash can icon. 

To set a card as default, hover over the card and **Set as Default**.

### Adding custom information to invoices

To add or edit the information on an invoice, navigate to your [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing) and select **Invoices** > **Edit Invoice Details** > **Billing Details**. 

Add or update your billing email, company name, address, and (if applicable) VAT ID. **Save Changes**, then go back to [invoices](http://go.postman.co/billing/invoices) > **Get Invoice** to view your automatically updated copy.

### Failed payments

If you have a card on file with us, our system will automatically attempt 3 times to charge it. If this is unsuccessful, team members will [billing privileges](/docs/postman-pro/managing-pro/managing-your-team/#managing-roles) will be notified via email.

[![failed payment email](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/failed-payment-email.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/failed-payment-email.jpg)

If payment is unsuccessful, we offer a grace period of 10 days to avoid service disruption. For invoice-based teams, this means 10 days following the due date listed on the invoice.

> All team members are notified in the event of non-payment and subsequent service deactivation in the Postman app.

## Team and plan changes

To change your team size, see [changing your plan](docs/postman-pro/managing-pro/changing-your-plan/). To upgrade to Postman Enterprise, see [purchasing Enterprise](/docs/postman-enterprise/purchasing-enterprise/).

### Changing billing cycle

Monthly teams are able to switch to an annual plan at any time by navigating to [billing](https://go.postman.co/billing/overview) > **Change Plan**. 

[![change plan](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/change-plan.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/change-plan.jpg)


Annual teams are able to switch to a monthly plan at the end of their current billing cycle.Â The number of days left in your current billing cycle is displayed under "Upcoming Invoice." 

### Purchasing monitoring blocks

Postman Enterprise teams are allotted 100,000 monitoring calls per month at no extra charge. Postman Pro teams are allotted 10,000 monitoring requests. 

Unless monitoring overages are [disabled](/docs/postman-pro/managing-pro/billing#managing-overages), you will be charged on a pay-as-you-go basis. See "Additional monitoring calls" on our [pricing page](https://www.getpostman.com/pricing).

To purchase monitoring blocks, go to [monitoring usage details](http://go.postman.co/usage/monitors) > **Set monitoring block count**.
