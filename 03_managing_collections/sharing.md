To share your collections with your team, you'll need to ensure that your team is on the Cloud Plan. You can view your plan details on your [team page][0]. If you're on the Cloud plan, you can sign in to the Postman app, click the 'More' button next to the collection name and hit 'Share'.

Click 'Share' in the modal that shows up to share the collection with your team. You can choose to share the collection as read-only, which means users who subscribe to it will not be able to edit it.

A team's shared collections can be viewed in the team library. This is where you can subscribe to collections that others have shared.
