### What is a Workspace?

A Workspace is an environment where you can manage Postman elements, permissions, and collaboration.

A Workspace is not a physical container. It is a view in an environment where elements, such as a collection,can exist in different workspaces at the same time. 


where team members and elements can belong to multiple workspaces at the same time.


e you can see different Workspaces at the same time. You can view Workspaces from the  

. A Workspace is a view, not a physical container.  Workspaces are viewable both from the Postman App and the user dashboard.


It provides individuals and teams easy access to all Postman elements and enhances collaboration. 

d.

Every Postman user has a dedicated workspace. And Postman Pro and Enterprise users have access to multiple workspaces, for personal and team.

Project-specific Workspaces provide superior organization and insight into your collections.
Workspaces now include shareable team request history, enabling developers to debug requests and API usage collaboratively.
Postman Environments can be synced and shared directly within Workspaces, without the need for templates.

Postman Pro and Enterprise users can create shared workspaces for ongoing development or short-term collaborations. Workspace members can be added and removed as needed, from among all of the organizationâ€™s paid users.

### Why use Workspaces?

Imagine this scenario. You're working in your own Collections in the Team Library, while collaborating with a few of your teammates. At the team level, a team might be working on different projects in parallel. 

Use personal workspaces for private projects, works in progress, and other experiment

Then at the team level, 

If a person is on Postman Pro using the Team Library they might be working on their own collections while also collaborating with several others. At the team level, there might be different projects that a team might be working in parallel. One goal that we established upfront was that every team member should have visibility into the team's API infrastructure. Otherwise, it would lead to a situation more like Google Drive where one doesn't know where something is and has to rely on links stored somewhere. While this is helpful, it can be confusing for companies with several teams. The teams might have internal APIs and external APIs for other teams.


To solve these issues, we need a new abstraction - called Workspaces.
 
### Types of Workspaces

Postman offers two types of Workspaces: personal and team. 

* Personal: Individual users can create workspaces that are only visible to them.

* Team: Workspaces shared between all members of a team. All workspaces that a user has visibility into should be accessible from the Postman app and the web
