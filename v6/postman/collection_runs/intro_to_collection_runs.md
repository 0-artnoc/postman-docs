Collections are groups of requests that can be run together as a series of requests, against a corresponding environment. 

Running a collection is useful when you want to automate API testing. When you run a collection, you send all requests in your collection one after another.

When you use scripts, you can build integration test suites, pass data between API requests, and build workflows that mirror your actual use case of APIs.

To run collections, you can use:

* Postman app collection runner located in the header bar.

* [Postman Monitors](/docs/postman/monitors/intro_monitors) to run collections in scheduled intervals.
