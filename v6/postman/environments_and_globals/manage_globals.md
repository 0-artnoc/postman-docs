This topic explains how to manage and view global variables.

### Managing global variables

To manage global variables, click the gear icon in the upper right corner of the Postman app and select "Manage Environments". 

Click on the **Globals** button at the bottom of the modal to reveal a key-value editor to add, edit, and delete global variables. You also can download your global variables as a single JSON file.
