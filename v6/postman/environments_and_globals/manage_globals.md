### Managing global variables

Click the gear icon in the upper right corner of the Postman app and select "Manage Environments". Click on the **Globals** button at the bottom of the modal to reveal a key-value editor to add, edit, and delete global variables. This is also where you can download your global variables as a single JSON file.
