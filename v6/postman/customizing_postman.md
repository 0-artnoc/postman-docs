### Customizing Request Methods

You can customize request methods to meet corporate,  team-wide and other specific requirements as needed. Once you create your own request methods, you'll be able to send/save them. 

This feature lets you to save/delete the custom method besides allowing you to delete default methods too. Just point your cursor to the dropdown of the request method area, click there, type your custom method name and send/save it. You can also send a request without saving this custom method. It's that simple! The following screen illustrates this procedure.

**Note:** You can only save your custom methods locally, which means these are not synced to the Postman servers. This essentially means signing out will cause your data to be lost. Also, Postman enables you to freely use any request having a custom method that is not saved in the list. The only constraint is that it will not appear in the request method drop-down.   

If you are in a team workspace and creating and using custom methods, the behavior of this feature is a little dynamic so we recommend you to note the following points:

1. When importing collections having requests with custom methods, you'll still be able to view these custom methods and be able to save by clicking the custom method.

2. You must be on the same version of the app or above (6.5.0) in order for you to effectively use this feature. 

3. Likewise, even if you are in the older version of Postman app, you'll still be able to view and consume custom methods from the History tab if your team member had created custom methods using the newest version of the app. However, you'll not be able to save these custom methods.

4. If you're in a team workspace and send a request by creating a custom method in it, your team members will not be able to view these custom methods unless they are on the same version of the app where these methods were created.

**Note:** Creating a mock with a custom method is currently not supported by Postman.
