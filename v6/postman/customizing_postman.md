### Customizing Postman

Postman allows you to create your own custom methods by enabling you to send/save your requests with custom methods. It also allows you to save/delete the custom method. To help you customize the entire method list, this feature also allows you to delete existing methods thereby giving the entire user control to you. Working with this feature is a breeze. Just point your cursor to the dropdown for the request method area, click there and start typing your custom method name and save it. It's that simple! The following screen illustrates this procedure.

**Note:** You can only save your custom methods locally, which means these are not synced to the Postman servers. This essentially means signing out will cause your data to be lost.
