You no longer will be required to work with duplicate or outdated copies of your collections and get your hands dirty with manual merges and other time-draining efforts. Postman's version control mechanism for Collections ensures you always have access to the latest and most updated versions of your collections. It's easy to see what has changed and you don't need to worry about out-of-date collections/requests. With this feature, different team members in a team workspace can access and work together on collections in a strongly-controlled efficient collaboration process. 

A user 'forks' a collection in a team workspace. This creates a local copy. In Postman parlance, forked collection is refereed to as 'Source'.  to as 'Destination' copy because the eventual goal is to merge it with the mainstream copy. Source is the forked copy.
The new copy is cloned to your local system.
User makes changes to the copy.
New commits are created for the changes.



 
All users with read access on a collection can initiate a merge. However, only users with write access can approve a merge.
If a user does not have write access to a destination collection in a merge action they're trying to perform, they can request a specific user with write access to approve the merge.
If a user themselves have write access to a destination collection, they can perform the merge without any approval.
