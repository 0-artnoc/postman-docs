Postman enables you to share your collections and environments in workspaces from the Postman app and the [Workspaces dashboard](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard){:target="_blank"}. 

**Note**: Before you can upload or share a collection, you must sign in to your [Postman account.](/docs/postman/launching_postman/postman_account) However, you can [share collections as a file](#sharing-as-a-file) regardless if you are signed in or not.

#### Sharing collections in the app

**In the sidebar**

In the Postman app, select a collection in the sidebar and click the ellipses **(...)** button.

Select "Share Collection". The **SHARE COLLECTION** modal appears. It offers three ways to share a collection: "Share in another workspace", "Embed", and "Get Link".

**Sharing collections in another workspace**

Select this option to add a collection to a team workspace. The collection is visible to the team.

In the [Workspaces dashboard](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard){:target="_blank"}, select a collection and then click the **Share** button. The collection is visible in your target workspace.

**Sharing collections with the Embed or Run In Postman button**

Select this option to embed a **[Run in Postman](/docs/v6/postman_for_publishers/run_button/creating_run_button){:target="_blank"}** button in your collection for your API documentation, website, or Github readme. 

The **Run in Postman** button lets anyone import and run this collection with one click. When you click the **Generate    Code** button, you get a link that you can use for a dynamic or static button. You can also select the environment you want for the generated code.

The **Run in Postman** button shares the collection directly from Postman, so the collection is uploaded to Postman servers when you generate the embed code

### Sharing as a file

Collections can be downloaded as a JSON file which you can share with others, with or without signing in through your Postman account. You can share collections anonymously, but it is strongly recommended to sign in to your Postman account when uploading collections. This will let you update your existing collection, make it public, or delete it later.
