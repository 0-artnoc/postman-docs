 Postman, besides storing "History" of all your requests, will also let you save the responses to your requests. This feature strengthens the collaboration aspect of Postman. You can view everything your team members send or receive using the history of these responses and can collaborate with them to debug or report issues. 
 
 To illustrate this with an example, let's consider two users as this enables us to switch between them for the sake of demonstration. 
 
 First, a user A sends a user A sends a pm.globals.set request which returns an error due to incorrect syntax. This throws an error. The other user B accesses the same request from the history tab, corrects the script and sends the request again. The following GIF illustrates this quite clearly how User B resolves the syntax and sends the request again.
