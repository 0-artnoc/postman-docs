 Postman, besides storing "History" of all your requests, will also let you save the responses to your requests. This feature strengthens the collaboration aspect of Postman. You can view everything your team members send or receive using the history of these responses and can collaborate with them to debug or report issues. 

 **Note:** To access response from the history tab of a user, you both need to be in the same team workspace. 
 
 To illustrate this with an example, let's consider two users as this enables us to switch between them for the sake of demonstration. 
 
 First, user A sends a pm.globals.set request which returns an error due to incorrect syntax. The other user B accesses the same request from the history tab, corrects the script and sends the request again. The pm.globals.set request is now successful. The following GIF illustrates quite clearly how User B resolves the syntax and sends the request again.
