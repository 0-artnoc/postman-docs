 Postman, besides storing "History" of all your requests, will also let you save the responses to your requests. This feature strengthens the collaboration aspect of Postman. You can view everything your team members send or receive using the history of these responses and can collaborate with them to debug or report issues. 
 
 To illustrate this with an example, let's consider two users as this enables us to switch between them for the sake of demonstration. First, a user A sends a get request to a URL (http://reqres.in/api/users) to fetch user 1 details. The other user B accesses the same request from the history tab,views the details of the user 1 (fetched from the URL by user A) and modifies and sends the request to fetch the details of user 2. User A again can access the details modified by User B. This is clearly illustrated in the following gif.
