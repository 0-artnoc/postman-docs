 History responses feature strengthens the collaboration aspect of Postman. You can use history responses as a collaboration tool working in a team workspace. You can view everything your team members send or receive using the history responses feature. You can collaborate with them easily and debug or report issues as well as see the requests they send. 

 Let's take a case in point. Go through the Gif below:

 [![history response 1](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/History_Response.gif)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/History_Response.gif)

 In the above gif file, you can see one of your team members has wrongly specified the environment variable in the pre-request script. You can correct it and your corrections can be viewed by your other team members in the history and responses section. They can also view and send this request from the history responses section.
