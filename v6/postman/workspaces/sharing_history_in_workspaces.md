 Postman, besides storing "History" of all your requests, will also let you save the responses. This feature strengthens the collaboration aspect of Postman. You can view everything your team members send or receive using the history of these responses and can collaborate with them to debug or report issues. 

 Let's take a case in point. Go through the Gif below:

 [![history response 1](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/History_Response.gif)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/History_Response.gif)

 In the above gif, you can see one of your team members specified an environment variable in the pre-request script which returns an error. You can make corrections and resend the request. Once you do this, you can see how a correct response is received and how the red button adjacent to the Pre-request Script turns from red to green. Your corrected version can again be viewed by other team members in the history and responses section who can in turn view and send this request from the history responses section.
