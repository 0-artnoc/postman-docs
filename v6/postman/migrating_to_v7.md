Migrating from your current version of Postman to Postman 7.0 is a big change. However, from the user perspective, the migration will be seamless as you don’t need to tweak any extra settings or configurations. Once you click the update button, Postman will migrate your entire data without any hassle. This section describes the steps/flow to migrate to Postman version 7.0. 

**Note**: Individual users can upgrade to version 7.0 as they normally do, without worrying about the steps described in this section.

This section describes the following topics:

* [Why migrate?](#why-migrate)
* [How to migrate](#how-to-migrate)

### Why migrate?

If you are a team user, you must migrate to version 7.0 to leverage fine-grained role-based access of Postman’s features. If you stay back on the older version of Postman app, you will not be able to: 

* Use role-based permissions which come with a fine-grained access management of some of Postman’s prominent features.

* Access new features and updates because new feature development will be based on version 7.0.

**Note:** If you migrate to version 7.0, the native apps 5.x and 6.x versions and Chrome app 5.x versions will not work as they are not supported.

### How to migrate?

This section illustrates the possible user flows and guides you through the migration process. Role-based access is a team feature. To use this feature, the entire team must be on Postman version 7.0. 

**Note:** The migration decision is restricted to the team Administrators. If you are a Postman team member and are not on Postman version 7.0, please contact your Administrator to migrate to version 7.0.   

The next section explains the following scenarios:

* [Team on Postman version 5/6](#team-on-postman-version-5/6) 
* [Team user on v7](#team-user-on-v7)

#### Team on Postman version 5/6

If you are an admin, you can go to the Postman dashboard and migrate to Postman v7. From your Postman dashboard, click **Settings** and then select **Roles and Permissions** to go to the following screen:

Click **Migrate my team to v7.0** and Postman takes care of the next steps for you and your team. 

#### Team user on v7

If you are in a team and download Postman version 7.0 when the entire team is on an older version, you will not be able to migrate to version 7.0. Postman displays a message saying you can’t access features on this version of Postman app until the team migrates to version 7.0.
