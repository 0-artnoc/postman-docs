Migrating from your current version of Postman to Postman 7.0 is a big change. However, from the user perspective, the migration will be seamless as you don’t need to tweak any extra settings or configurations. Once you click the update button, Postman will migrate your entire data without any hassle. This section describes the steps/flow to migrate to Postman version 7.0. 

**Note**: Individual users can upgrade to version 7.0 as they normally do, without worrying about the steps described in this section.

This section describes the following topics:

* [Why migrate?](#why-migrate)
* [How to migrate](#how-to-migrate)

### Why migrate?

If you are a team user, you must migrate to version 7.0 to leverage fine-grained role-based access of Postman’s features. If you stay back on the older version of Postman app, you will not be able to: 

* Use role-based permissions which come with a fine-grained access management of some of Postman’s prominent features.

* Access new features and updates because new feature development will be based on version 7.0.

**Note:** If you migrate to version 7.0, the native apps 6.x versions and Chrome app 5.x versions will not work as they are not supported.

### How to migrate?

This section illustrates the possible user flows and guides you through the migration process. Role-based access is a team feature. To use this feature, the entire team must be on Postman version 7.0. 

**Note:** The migration decision is restricted to the team Administrator. If you are a Postman team member and are not on Postman version 7.0, please contact your Administrator to migrate to version 7.0.   

This section explains the following scenarios:
* Entire team on older version 
* A team user is on version 7.0

#### Entire team on older version

In a scenario where the entire team is on older version of Postman, the Postman app displays a message to the team admins asking if they want to upgrade to version 7.0. If the admin moves to version 7.0, then Postman will prompt the admin if he wants to move the entire team to version 7.0. Once the admin takes a decision to migrate the entire team, Postman automatically pushes the update and all team users must update the app.

#### Team user on Postman 7.0

If you are in a team and download Postman version 7.0 when the entire team is on an older version, you will not be able to migrate to version 7.0. Postman displays a message saying you can’t access features on this version of Postman app until the team migrates to version 7.0. If you happen to be on 7.0, click here to download 6.7.3.
