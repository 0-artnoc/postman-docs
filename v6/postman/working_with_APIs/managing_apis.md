### Creating an API

You can create an API in the workspace from the sidebar when there are no APIs in the current workspace or by clicking new API button in the sidebar. Clicking the API in the sidebar opens it in a tab. If there are multiple versions of the API, Postman opens the most recently created. 

**Note:** You can create an API only when you are signed-in and the sync is connected. Also, if you are a free user you can create only one API. 


Once you create an API, you can perform the following tasks on the API:

* Define an API
* Develop an API
* Test an API
* Observe an API

#### Define an API

You can create or import a new schema in an API. To create a new schema, click 'Add Schema' and select 'Create New'. To import an existing schema, click 'Add Schema' and select Import file'. Clicking 'Add a Schema' opens the schema editor with default options selected. The default schema is 'Open API 3.0' and JSON the default language. After creating/importing the schema, you can edit and save the changes. Soon after you save the changes, the 'Generate Collection' and 'View Changelog' buttons are enabled for you. 

Other schemas supported:

* Swagger 2.0
* Swagger 1.0
* RAML 1.0
* RAML 0.8

Languages supported:

* JSON
* YAML
* XML

**Note:** Multi-file variants of schemas are not supported. 


#### Develop an API

After adding a schema to your API, you can develop your API by linking a mock server, documentation and environment to specific versions of your API. 

* Add a Mock Server

* Add Documentation

* Add an Environment



#### Test an API




#### Observe an API



### Updating API information

You can update API information like name and description and so on. You can add a description to your API by clicking 'Add a description' button. Click '>' to view the API description. 

### Sharing an API




### Manage API Roles 

You can manage roles and permissions on your APIs using the role-based access permissions of Postman. 








### Editing and viewing API details

Expand the arrow (&#9656;) to show the details view for the collection. Collapse the arrow (&#9666;) to hide the details view. You can add metadata like name and description so that all the information a developer needs to use your API is available easily.
