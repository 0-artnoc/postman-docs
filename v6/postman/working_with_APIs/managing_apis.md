### Creating an API

You can create an API in the workspace from the sidebar in the Postman app and from the workspaces dashboard. To create an API in the Postman app when no APIs exist in the current workspace, click **Create an API** button in the sidebar, as illustrated in a red circle in the following screen: 

[![api create1](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/API-Create2.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/API-Create2.png)

To create an API when APIs exist in your workspace, click '+' in the sidebar, as illustrated in a blue colored square. The following screen opens:

[![api create2](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/API-Create1.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/API-Create1.png)

Specify a name for your API. Your API is saved with a default version 'Draft'. Once the API is created, you can open the API and view the details in the tab. 

**Note:** You can create an API only when you are signed-in and the sync is connected. Remember, if you are a free user you can create only one API. 

Alternatively, you can also create an API from your workspaces dashboard as illustrated in the following screen:

[![api create3](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/API-Create3.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/API-Create3.png)

Navigate to the APIs tab and click **Create an API** button, shown in a red circle in the above screen. The following screen opens.  

[![api create4](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/API-Create4-Dashboard.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/API-Create3-Dashboard.png)

Specify a name for your API and click the '&#9745;' adjacent to the name. Your API is created. 


### Opening and viewing API 

In the sidebar, click the API you want to open in a tab. If there are multiple versions of the API, Postman opens the most recently created. 

[![open and view api](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/API-Open-and-View1.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/API-Open-and-View1.png)

Using the above interface, you can navigate and view various entities of the API like mocks, monitors, documentation, and so on. 


### Deleting an API

Click the ellipsis (...) next to an API, and select "Delete API". If you didn't intend to delete the API, you can always recover your deleted APIs. Refer to the next section Recover a collection to learn how to retrieve your deleted collections.

### Removing from workspace

From the Postman app, you can remove an API from the sidebar. Click the ellipsis (...) next to the API you would like to remove, select **Remove from workspace** and confirm that you would like to remove the API from the current workspace. The API will no longer be visible in the workspace.


### Updating API information

You can update API information like name, description and so on. You can add a description to your API by clicking **Add a description** button. Click '>' to view the API description. 


### Editing and viewing API details

Expand the arrow (&#9656;) to show the details view for the collection. Collapse the arrow (&#9666;) to hide the details view. You can add metadata like name and description so that all the information a developer needs to use your API is available easily.
