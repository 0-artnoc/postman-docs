You can create and manage your APIs in the workspace like create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) using Postman. This section describes the following topics:

* [Creating an API](#creating-an-api)
* [Opening and viewing an API](#Opening-and-viewing-an-API])
* [Renaming an API](#renaming-an-api)
* [Renaming an API version](#renaming-an-api-version)
* [Deleting an API](#deleting-an-api)
* [Removing an API from workspace](#removing-an-api-from-workspace)


### Creating an API 

You can create an API in the workspace from the sidebar in the Postman app and from the workspaces dashboard. To create an API in the Postman app when no APIs exist in the current workspace, click **Create an API** button in the sidebar, as illustrated in a red circle in the following screen: 

[![api create1](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/API-Create2.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/API-Create2.png)

To create an API when APIs exist in your workspace, click '+' in the sidebar, as highlighted in blue colored square in the above screen. The following screen opens:

[![api create2](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/API-Create1.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/API-Create1.png)

Specify a name for your API. Your API is saved with a default version *Draft*. 
**Note:** You can create an API only when you are signed in and the sync is connected. Remember, if you are a free user you can create only one API. 

Alternatively, you can also create an API from your workspaces dashboard as illustrated in the following screen:

[![api create3](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/API-Create3.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/API-Create3.png)

Navigate to the APIs tab and click **Create an API** button, shown in a red circle in the above screen. The following screen opens.  

[![api create4](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/API-Create4-Dashboard.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/API-Create3-Dashboard.png)

Specify a name for your API and click the '&#9745;' adjacent to the name. Your API is created. 

### Opening and viewing an API 

In the sidebar, click the API you want to open in a tab. If there are multiple versions of the API, Postman opens the most recently created. 

[![open and view api](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/API-Open-and-View1.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/API-Open-and-View1.png)

Using the above interface, you can navigate and view various entities of the API like mocks, monitors, documentation, and so on.

### Renaming an API

To rename an API, select the API in the sidebar. On the top right corner, click ellipsis (...), as illustrated below:

[![api create3](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/API-Rename1.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/API-Rename1.png)

Go ahead, specify a new name and press enter. 

### Renaming an API version

Postman allows you to rename the *Draft* version tag of your API. To rename the API version, click **Show All Versions**, the following screen appears: 

[![api version update](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/API-Delete-Version1.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/API-Delete-Version1.png)

In the above screen, select **Rename** and specify a new name. 

### Deleting an API

Click the ellipsis (...) next to an API, and select "Delete API", as illustrated in the following screen:

[![api delete](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/API-Delete1.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/API-Delete1.png)

#### Deleting an API version

You can also delete a specific version of your API. To delete a specific version of the API, click ellipsis (...), as illustrated in the following screen and select **Delete**. 

[![api delete](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/API-Delete-Version1.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/API-Delete-Version1.png)

### Removing an API from workspace

From the Postman app, you can remove an API from the sidebar. Click the ellipsis (...) next to the API you would like to remove, select **Remove from workspace** and confirm that you would like to remove the API from the current workspace. The API will no longer be visible in the workspace. 

You will be able to perform all these user actions even from the dashboard, as illustrated in the screen below:

[![api create5](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/API-Create5-Dashboard.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/API-Create5-Dashboard.png)
