### Overview

With the introduction of API modules in Postman, your cross-functional API development process becomes better and faster. You will now be able to define and manage different versions of your APIs, collection revisions, and other components linked to API versions like monitors, mocks and etc. You will be able to coordinate API changes easily with the help of versioning and linking. 

Essentially, with the APIs in Postman, your schema is now treated as the source of truth which defines all possible variations of the API. Collections can now be used as individual recipes which use endpoints made available by the API, tailored to specific use cases. As Postman allows you to map your real-time APIs in the API tab, you will be able to define, develop, test, and observe them - all in one place. 

Let's say you are a test engineer who is interested only in the test suites connected to an API but you are working with a technical writer and a developer. The writer is interested in documentation published under an API while the developer is working on mocks and monitors attached to the API. Three of you can now work on the same API definition instead of working on the same collection which is not the best way to do. Even as the definition of your API becomes dynamic, the API itself is your collaboration point while individual collections under it become different use cases for the API in contention. 

With the APIs in Postman, you can perform the following tasks:

* Create and manage APIs in your workspace, keep them consistent and backward-compatible 

* Link collections (and their revisions) to specific versions of the APIs. 

* Represent other elements like schemas, metrics, and gateways. 

* Create/import schema and make changes

* Create and manage versions of the APIs

* Manage roles and permissions on APIs

* Generate collections from the API schema

* Share APIs with your teams and members

* Streamline the entire API workflow to save yourself time and stress

* Iterate on your API enhancements in a much more dynamic, secure and confident way

* View and analyze reports
