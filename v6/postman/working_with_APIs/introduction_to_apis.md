### Overview

Postman enables you to expedite the API development with the introduction of API as an entity. With this, you will be able to map your real-time APIs inside Postman and be able to define and manage them throughout the API lifecycle. 

You will be able to link versions of collections to specific APIs and their versions. You will be able to represent other entities like schemas, metrics, and gateways. You will also be able to view and analyze reports and get deeper insights into each of these API entities. 

 You can define and edit a schema and can even change its format and language. You can also generate a collection from the schema. Besides, you can define a schema and other properties surrounding the API in Postman.  


With the APIs in Postman, you can perform the following tasks:

* Create and manage APIs in your workspace

* Create or import schema

* Create and manage versions of the APIs

* Manage roles and permissions on APIs

* Generate collections from the API schema

* Share APIs with your teams and members

* View and analyze reports


### Why create APIs?

Here are several reasons why you should create APIs.

#### Organization 

You can group together various entities like collections, monitors, mocks, documentation and etc under a single API, so that you have everything attached to an API under a single entity. This will make it easy for collaboration, reference, and 

Documentation
You can add a name and descriptions to requests, folders, and collections. In Postman, you can use the collection browser to view the documentation. In Postman Pro, you can create and publish beautiful API documentation pages.

Test suites
You can attach test scripts to requests and build integration test suites.
