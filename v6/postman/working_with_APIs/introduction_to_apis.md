### Overview

Postman's API feature provides you an end-to-end API development platform to help accelerate the API development process. With this you will be able to build an abstraction of the API in Postman. You will also be able to represent API entities like schemas, metrics, and gateways in Postman. As part of this, Postman also offers reporting tools and services to provide insights into each of these API entities. 

You can create and manage your APIs in the workspace, update meta information like name, description, and so on, and create or import a new schema in an API. You will be able to link mocks, documentation and environments to an API and even be able to version them. You will also be able to link test suites, integration tests, and contract tests to specific versions of an API.
