### Overview

Postman's API Development Platform attempts to make the API development process faster and better. With this, you will be able to build an abstraction of the API in Postman. You will also be able to represent API entities like schemas, metrics, and gateways and be able to generate reports to get deeper insights into each of these API entities. 

You can perform the following tasks with the API feature in Postman:

* Create and manage APIs in your workspace

* Create or import schema

* Create and manage versions the APIs

* Manage roles and permissions on APIs

* Generate collections from API schema

* Generate and analyze reports
