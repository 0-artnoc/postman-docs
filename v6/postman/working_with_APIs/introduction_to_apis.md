### Overview

Postman makes your API development faster with the introduction of API as an entity. With this, the cross-functional API development process becomes even more robust and collaborative. You will be able to map your real-time APIs inside Postman and be able to define and manage them easily throughout the API life cycle. It also lets you organize your various API resources and the implementation logic at one place.

With the APIs in Postman, you can perform the following tasks:

* Create and manage APIs in your workspace

* Link collections (and their versions) to specific versions of the APIs. 

* Represent other entities like schemas, metrics, and gateways. 

* Create or import schema

* Create and manage versions of the APIs

* Manage roles and permissions on APIs

* Generate collections from the API schema

* Share APIs with your teams and members

* View and analyze reports


### Why create APIs?

Here are several reasons why you should create APIs.

#### Organization 

You can group together various entities like collections, monitors, mocks, documentation and etc under a single API, so that you have everything attached to an API under a single entity. This will make it easy for collaboration, reference, and your productivity. 

Documentation
You can add a name and descriptions to requests, folders, and collections. In Postman, you can use the collection browser to view the documentation. In Postman Pro, you can create and publish beautiful API documentation pages.

Test suites
You can attach test scripts to requests and build integration test suites.
