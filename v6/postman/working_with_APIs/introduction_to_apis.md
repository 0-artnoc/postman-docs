### What is a Postman Collection?

Postman's API feature provides you an end-to-end API development platform which will help accelerate the API development process. With this you will be able to build an abstraction of the API in Postman. You will also be able to represent API entities like schemas, metrics, and gateways. As part of this, Postman also offers reporting tools and services to provide insights into each of these API entities.

### Why create collections?

Here are several reasons why you should create collections.

#### OrganizationÂ 
You can group together requests into folders and collections, so that you don't have to search through your history repeatedly.

#### Documentation
You can add a name and descriptions to requests, folders, and collections. In Postman, you can use the collection browser to view the documentation. In Postman Pro, you can create and publish beautiful API documentation pages.

#### Test suites
You can attach test scripts to requests and build integration test suites.

#### Conditional workflows
You can use scripts to pass data between API requests and build workflows that mirror your actual API use case.
