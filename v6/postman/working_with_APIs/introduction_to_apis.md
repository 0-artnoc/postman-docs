### Overview

Postman makes your API development robust and collaborative with the introduction of API as an entity. With this, the cross-functional API development process becomes better and faster enabling you to build APIs quicker. You will be able to map your real-time APIs inside Postman and be able to define and easily manage different variants of the API versions. It also lets you organize your various API resources and the implementation logic at one place so that it's easier for multiple teams to collaborate on API development.

With the APIs in Postman, you can perform the following tasks:

* Create and manage APIs in your workspace

* Link collections (and their versions) to specific versions of the APIs. 

* Represent other entities like schemas, metrics, and gateways. 

* Create or import schema

* Create and manage versions of the APIs

* Manage roles and permissions on APIs

* Generate collections from the API schema

* Share APIs with your teams and members

* Coordinate the API changes easily with the help of versioning

* View and analyze reports


### Why create APIs?

Here are several reasons why you should create APIs.

#### Organization 

You can group together various entities like collections, monitors, mocks, documentation and etc under a single API, so that you have everything attached to an API under a single entity. This will make it easy for collaboration, reference, and your productivity. 




### A Sample API workflow in Postman

Let's take an example use case wherein
