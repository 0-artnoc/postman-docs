### Overview


Postman enables you to expedite the API development process with the introduction of API abstraction. With this, you will be able to build an abstraction of the API in Postman. You will also be able to represent API entities like schemas, metrics, and gateways and be able to analyze reports to get deeper insights into each of these API entities. 

You can create an API abstraction, give it a name, the description, a summary, you can define a schema, you can save the schema, you can go back and edit the schema, change the format of the schema, you can edit the language of the schema. You can also generate a collection from the schema. You can define a schema and other properties for the API in Postman.  


You can perform the following tasks with the API feature in Postman:

* Create and manage APIs in your workspace

* Create or import schema

* Create and manage versions the APIs

* Manage roles and permissions on APIs

* Generate collections from API schema

* Generate and analyze reports


Why create APIs?

Here are several reasons why you should create APIs.

Organization 

You can group together various entities like collections, monitors, mocks, documentation and etc under a single API, so that you have everything attached to an API under a single entity.

Documentation
You can add a name and descriptions to requests, folders, and collections. In Postman, you can use the collection browser to view the documentation. In Postman Pro, you can create and publish beautiful API documentation pages.

Test suites
You can attach test scripts to requests and build integration test suites.
