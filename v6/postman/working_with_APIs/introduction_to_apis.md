### Overview

Postman's API Development Platform attempts to make the API development process faster and better. With this, you will be able to build an abstraction of the API in Postman. You will also be able to represent API entities like schemas, metrics, and gateways and be able to generate reports to get deeper insights into each of these API entities. 

You can perform the following tasks with the API feature in Postman:

* Create and manage APIs in your workspace

* Create or import schema

* Create and manage versions the APIs

* Manage roles and permissions on APIs

* Generate collections from API schema

* Generate and analyze reports


Why create APIs?

Here are several reasons why you should create APIs.

Organization 

You can group together requests into folders and collections, so that you don't have to search through your history repeatedly.

Documentation
You can add a name and descriptions to requests, folders, and collections. In Postman, you can use the collection browser to view the documentation. In Postman Pro, you can create and publish beautiful API documentation pages.

Test suites
You can attach test scripts to requests and build integration test suites.
