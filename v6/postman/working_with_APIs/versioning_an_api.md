Postman allows you to manage multiple versions of your APIs. You typically start a new version when you need to add new API operations or parameters, add data models, and so on. Once a new version is ready to be consumed by client applications, you can publish it. This way you can continually enhance your APIs while having a clean published version for your API consumers.


You can version your APIs and even create additional versions out of your API

* [Creating an API](#creating-an-api)
* [Sharing an API](#sharing-an-api)
* [Managing Roles](#managing-roles)
* [Deleting an API](#deleting-an-api)
* [Removing API from workspace](removing-api-from-workspace)

To manage roles on your API, in the Postman app, select an API in the sidebar and click ellipsis (...). The following screen opens:
