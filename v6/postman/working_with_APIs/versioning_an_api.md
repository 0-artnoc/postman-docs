Postman allows you to manage multiple versions of your APIs. You typically start a new version of an API when you make a small enhancement or when you add new fields/new endpoints/resources to an existing API. 

This section describes the following topics:

* [Creating API versions](#creating-api-versions)
* [Linking collections to APIs](#linking-collections-to-apis)
* [Managing versions](managing-versions)

* [Sharing an API](#sharing-an-api)
* [Managing Roles](#managing-roles)
* [Deleting an API](#deleting-an-api)
