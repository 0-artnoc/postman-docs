Postman allows you to manage multiple versions of your APIs. You typically start a new version of an API when you make a small enhancement or when you add new fields/new endpoints/resources to an existing API. You can tag a collection with only one API version. Which means at no point in time you can find a collection     

You can run monitors on all versions of your collections and APIs. 

This section describes the following topics:

* [Creating API versions](#creating-api-versions)
* [Renaming API versions](#renaming-api-versions)
* [Linking collections to APIs](#linking-collections-to-apis)
* [Tagging a collection with API version](#tagging-a-collection-with-API-version)
* [Managing versions](managing-versions)


### Creating API versions

Postman, by default, creates a *Draft* version of the API the moment you create an API. To rename your *Draft* version, refer to the next section. You can create versions of your API from an existing version. 

#### Creating a new version

To create a new version of an API, click **Show All Versions**, as illustrated in the following screen:

[![api all versions](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/API-Create1-Showallversions1.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/API-Create1-Showallversions1.png)

The following screen appears:

[![api create new version](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/API-Create1-NewVersion1.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/API-Create1-NewVersion1.png)

Click **Create another version** to go to the following screen:

[![api create new version2](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/API-Create1-NewVersion2.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/API-Create1-NewVersion2.png)

Specify a new version of your API. This version is based on your **Draft** version. In the **Carry over elements from a previous version** list, select **Draft** if you want to carry over the elements. Else, select **Don't carry over any elements** to create a new API from scratch. Uncheck the corresponding checkbox to omit an element from carrying over. Click **Create Version**. Postman creates a new version of your API and takes you to the API workflow screen where you can *define, develop, test, and observe* your API. 

(Need to add link in above para)

### Renaming API versions

A default *Draft* version of the API is created when you first create an API. You can rename the *Draft* version of your API. To rename the version of your API, click **Show All Versions**. The following screen opens:

[![api version rename](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/API-Version-Rename1.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/API-Version-Rename1.png)

In the above screen, click (...) and select **Rename** to update the version name of your API.
