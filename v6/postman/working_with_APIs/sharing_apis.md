You can easily share your APIs with other users and teams on Postman - both in the app and in the [workspaces dashboard](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard). Once you share an API, you can assign individual permissions to your team members. You can designate view (Viewer) or edit (Editor) permissions to the team/members. 

This topic covers:

* [Sharing APIs in the Dashboard](#sharing-apis-in-the-dashboard)

### Sharing APIs in the app

**In the sidebar**

In the Postman app, select an API in the sidebar and click ellipsis (...). Select **Share API**. The **Share API** screen appears, as illustrated below:

You can share the API with the workspace members individually or with an entire workspace. Search for the workspace name in the top search bar and select the corresponding workspace to share the API. To share the API with individual workspace members, enter the name in the search bar under **Workspace members** (illustrated in red circle in the above screen), select the corresponding member and click **Save and Continue**. Your API is shared and the following screen appears:

In the above screen, you can manage the roles and permissions for the shared API. You can either assign an *Editor* role or a *Viewer* role. Click **Save Roles**. 

### Sharing APIs in the dashboard

In the [workspaces dashboard](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard), click the corresponding **Share** button of the API. The **Share API** button is shown in the below screen. The procedure, after clicking **Share API** button is similar as in app. Refer to the section above **Sharing APIs in the app** for further information.
