Postman enables you to share APIs in workspaces from the Postman app and the [workspaces dashboard](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard).

* [Sharing api in the Dashboard](#sharing-apis-in-the-dashboard)

### Sharing APIs in the app

**In the sidebar**

In the Postman app, select an API in the sidebar and click ellipsis **(...)**.

Select "Share API". 

The **Share API** screen appears, as illustrated below:  

[![api share sidebar](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/API-Share1.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/API-Share1.png)

You can share the API to the workspace members individually or to the entire workspace. Search for the workspace name in the top search bar and select the corresponding workspace to share the API. To share the API with individual workspace members, enter the name in the search bar under **Workspace members** (illustrated in red circle in the above screen), select the corresponding member and click **Save and Continue**. Your API is shared and the following screen appears:

[![api manage roles](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/API-Manage-Roles.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/API-Manage-Roles.png)

In the above screen, you can manage the roles and permissions for the shared API. You can either assign an *Editor* role or a *Viewer* role. Click **Save Roles**. 

### Sharing APIs in the dashboard

In the [workspaces dashboard](https://app.getpostman.com/dashboard), click the corresponding **Share** button of the API. The **Share API** screen appears. The procedure from here is similar so refer to **Sharing APIs in the app** section for further information.
