### Find and Replace in Postman

Finding and replacing text in your API projects is quick and easy in Postman. The Postman app enables you to perform a global find and replace operation that works seamlessly across its various components like Collections, Environments, Globals, and Open tabs. Postman's find and replace functionality supports both simple text-based search and replace as well as advanced search and replace that lets you choose entities like Collections, Environments, Globals, and Tabs. 

You can easily launch the Find and replace panel. To do that, in the Postman's main interface, click the find icon at the bottom of the sidebar, as illustrated in the screen below:

Click the find icon to launch the find and replace panel, as illustrated in the screen below:

The Find and Replace panel also contains options for toggling case sensitivity, performing regular expression matching and scoping the search to selections.

Let's perform a search operation and find and replace a string 'pstman' by keeping the scope to 'everything'. This is illustrated in the screen below:

In the above screen, you can clearly see the results that show how the string 'postman' is searched and replaced with 'pstman'. You can limit a search to a subset of the files/scopes/entities in your API project by selecting the radio button 'Choose entities to find in'.
