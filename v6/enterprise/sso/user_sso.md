After a team admin has enabled single sign on (**SSO**) for Postman, users can log in to Postman with a configured Identity provider in two ways:

1.  Ask the team admin for the **Login URL** that was generated during the SSO configuration. The **Login URL** automatically redirects the user to the configured Identity Provider.

2.  Click the **Sign in to Enterprise** button in the Postman app,  or click the hyperlink from in Postman web.

    *  In Postman App, use the hyperlink at the top right while signing in. On clicking it, a new window will be opened within the app.

    *  In this step, enter **Team Domain** to continue.

    *  Next, user will be redirected to the configured Identity Provider. Here, for example the **G-Suite** Login screen.
