API Network makes API consumption very easy. If you are building APIs that can be consumed by the public, you can publish them to our API network and users can directly “Run it in Postman”. But we need to make sure all APIs published meet a certain set of guidelines to be readily consumable. 

 Ensure the following guidelines are met:

1. Logo - All API Network submissions must have a logo. This helps with associating your team/company with your API.
2. API Name & Description - An appropriate name and a proper description helps explain your API’s intended use.
3. Summary & Team Description - Make sure your API has proper summary, description and Team description.
4. Right Categories - Choose appropriate categories. This will help consumers to easily search for your API.
5. Authentication - All API Network submissions should clearly explain steps for authentication in detail. This helps the users of the API to get started and using the API *
6. Proper Formatting - Make sure your documentation is properly formatted with folders
7. Requests and Responses - Mention example requests and responses **
8. Other recommendations - Have proper


* If there are authorization tokens in the request headers, please replace them with a placeholder. This makes your documentation secure and readable
* Local servers do not make sense in the context of APIs for API Network. API submissions cannot have localhost paths.
