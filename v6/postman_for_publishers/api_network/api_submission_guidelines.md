### Why adhere to guidelines?

Postman's API Network makes API consumption very easy. If you are building APIs that can be consumed by public, you can publish them to our API network and users can directly “Run it in Postman”. To publish your APIs to Postman's API network ensure all your APIs adhere to a set of guidelines outlined by Postman. 

### API format guidelines

To ensure your APIs have a wider adoption, adhere to the following guidelines:

1. Logo
   
   All API Network submissions must contain a logo. Logo gives you a better identity and helps users easily associate the API with your company.

2. API Name & Description

   An appropriate name and a proper description helps explain your API’s intended use. The following illustrates an example:

3. Summary & Team Description 

   Make sure your API has proper summary, description and Team description.

4. Category 

   Choose an appropriate category. This helps users search for your API easily.

5. Authentication 

   All API Network submissions should clearly explain steps for authentication in detail. This helps your API users get started easily. 

   **Note:** If there are authorization tokens in the request headers replace them with a placeholder. This makes your documentation secure and readable. The following screen illustrates this:

6. Proper Formatting 

   Make sure your documentation is properly formatted with folders

7. Requests and Responses 

   Specify example requests and responses. Do not submit examples containing localhost paths because they don't make sense for APIs in the API network. The following screen illustrates an example of this:
