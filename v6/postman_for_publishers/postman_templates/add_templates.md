If you’re an author of a Postman collection, you can share the API documentation in a bunch of different ways. One way is to share the collection as a template. Community-contributed templates might teach someone how to use an API, automate a tedious task, or just use public APIs to do something fun. Once you create a template, it’s discoverable within the Postman app. People can browse, download relevant templates, and get a jump-start on learning something new.

### How to add to Postman Templates

You can share your collection with the API community by selecting the radio button 'Add to Postman Templates'. The template name is auto populated from your collection name, as illustrated in the below screen. You can input template description, add categories and click 'Publish Collection'.
