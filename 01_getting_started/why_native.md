Postman's [native apps](http://www.getpostman.com/apps) (for Mac and Windows) run on [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/), 
and provide a overcome a number of restrictions of the Chrome platform.

A few features exclusive to the native apps are listed here:

1. [Cookies](http://www.getpostman.com/docs/cookies):
The native apps let you work with cookies directly. Unlike the Chrome app, no separate extension is needed.<br>

2. [Built-in proxy] (http://www.getpostman.com/docs/capture_mac):
The native apps come with a built-in proxy that you can use to capture network traffic. 


3. Menu bar: The Chrome app had a very limited menu bar.
With the native apps you can create collections, switch to History requests, and more!<br>

4. Update notifications

Chrome used to update the Posmtan app haphazardly, without any sort of notification shown to the user. 
With the native apps, you have control over when and if you want to update. Release notes for the new versions are shown too.
